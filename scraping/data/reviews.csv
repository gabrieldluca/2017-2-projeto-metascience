The Grandmaster,Manohla Dargis,73,100,"The Grandmaster is, at its most persuasive, about the triumph of style. When Ip Man slyly asks “What’s your style?” it’s clear that Mr. Wong is asking the same question because here, as in his other films, style isn’t reducible to ravishing surfaces; it’s an expression of meaning.","Aug 22, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-grandmasters/details
Of Gods and Men,A.O. Scott,86,100,"Of Gods and Men is supple and suspenseful, appropriately austere without being overly harsh, and without forgoing the customary pleasures of cinema. The performances are strong, the narrative gathers momentum as it progresses, and the camera is alive to the beauty of the Algerian countryside.","Feb 24, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/of-gods-and-men/details
Kubo and the Two Strings,Glenn Kenny,84,100,"The action is gorgeously fluid, the idiosyncratic 3-D visual conceits (including floating eyeballs undersea) are startling, and the story and its metaphors resolve in unexpected and moving ways.","Aug 18, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kubo-and-the-two-strings/details
Jane,Ben Kenigsberg,87,100,Jane will delight those familiar with Ms. Goodall and provide a vibrant introduction for newcomers.,"Oct 19, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jane/details
Bird People,A.O. Scott,70,100,"There are plot twists, and then there is what Ms. Ferran does here, which is to transform — impetuously, improbably and altogether marvelously — this somber, realistic tale into something else entirely.","Sep 11, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bird-people/details
The Waiting Room,Stephen Holden,84,100,"Scrupulously apolitical, The Waiting Room is the opposite of a polemic like Michael Moore's ""Sicko."" But by removing any editorial screen, it confronts you head-on with human suffering that a more humane and equitable system might help alleviate.","Sep 25, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-waiting-room/details
Field Niggas,Glenn Kenny,83,100,"While the movie’s multiple images are never less than numinous, and its rhythms sometimes skirt the strangely seductive, this astonishing movie is the opposite of hypnotic.","Oct 15, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/field-niggas/details
Being John Malkovich,Janet Maslin,90,100,"Irresistable, nimble and very funny.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/being-john-malkovich/details
The Tree of Life,A.O. Scott,85,100,"With disarming sincerity and daunting formal sophistication The Tree of Life ponders some of the hardest and most persistent questions, the kind that leave adults speechless when children ask them.","May 26, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-tree-of-life/details
Argo,Manohla Dargis,86,100,It's a doozy of a story and so borderline ridiculous that it sounds - ta-da! - like something that could have been cooked up only by Hollywood.,"Oct 11, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/argo/details
Okja,A.O. Scott,76,100,"The picture, which never stops moving, is dense with information and feeling. Barbs of satire pop up and are washed away on streams of strong emotion. It’s all marvelously preposterous and yet, at the same time, something important is at stake.","Jun 27, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/okja/details
Summer Palace,A.O. Scott,79,100,"In Summer Palace Lou nonetheless succeeds in finding a cinematic language that does more than summarize the important events of a confusing decade. He distills the inner confusion -- the swirl of moods, whims and needs -- that is the lived and living essence of history.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/summer-palace/details
Aferim!,A.O. Scott,84,100,"Shot in richly toned, wide-screen black and white, Aferim! looks like an elegant exercise in period playacting. But it casts a fierce, revisionist eye on the past, finding the cruelty and prejudice that lie beneath the pageantry.","Jan 21, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/aferim!/details
Spring Breakers,Manohla Dargis,63,100,"In Spring Breakers [Mr. Korine] bores into a contested, deeply American topic — the pursuit of happiness taken to nihilistic extremes — but turns his exploration into such a gonzo, outrageously funny party that it takes a while to appreciate that this is more of a horror film than a comedy.","Mar 14, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/spring-breakers/details
Inherent Vice,Manohla Dargis,81,100,"Mr. Phoenix’s note-perfect performance flows on the story’s currents of comedy that occasionally turn into rapids, as the funny ha-ha, funny strange back-and-forth abruptly gives way to Three Stooges slapstick.","Dec 11, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/inherent-vice/details
After Life,Stephen Holden,91,100,"After Life becomes a quiet, extraordinarily moving and sometimes funny meditation on the meaning and value of life. It intimates that whatever happiness we may find in life comes from within and is self-created.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/after-life/details
Elena,Stephen Holden,87,100,"Post-Soviet Russia in Andrei Zvyagintsev's somber, gripping film Elena is a moral vacuum where money rules, the haves are contemptuous of the have-nots, and class resentment simmers. The movie, which shuttles between the center of Moscow and its outskirts, is grim enough to suggest that even if you were rich, you wouldn't want to live there.","May 17, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/elena/details
Drinking Buddies,A.O. Scott,71,100,"Drinking Buddies, Joe Swanberg’s nimble, knowing and altogether excellent new film, refuses to dance to the usual tune.","Aug 22, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/drinking-buddies/details
"20,000 Days on Earth",Stephen Holden,83,100,It is as intimate and honest a portrait of a rock artist’s creative roots as any film has attempted.,"Sep 17, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/20000-days-on-earth/details
The Dirties,Jeannette Catsoulis,65,100,"Remarkable as much for its insights as for its audacity, The Dirties approaches school violence with a comic veneer that slowly shades into deep darkness.","Oct  3, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-dirties/details
Neon Bull,Stephen Holden,80,100,Neon Bull is a profound reflection on the intersection of the human and bestial.,"Apr  7, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/neon-bull/details
Goodbye Solo,A.O. Scott,89,100,"Grace is also what defines Mr. Bahrani's filmmaking. I can't think of anything else to call the quality of exquisite attention, wry humor and wide-awake intelligence that informs every frame of this almost perfect film.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/goodbye-solo/details
Newtown,Neil Genzlinger,87,100,"This film isn’t content to be merely a “never forget” reminder; it wants to convey just how deep and lasting the pain is, from this attack and, by extension, many others.","Oct  6, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/newtown/details
Short Cuts,Vincent Canby,79,100,"It raises the spirits not by phony sentimentality but by the amplitude of its art. From time to time, it is also roaringly funny... A terrific movie. [1 Oct 1993, p.C1]",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/short-cuts/details
Side by Side,A.O. Scott,82,100,"For a film geek this movie is absolute heaven, a dream symposium in which directors, cinematographers, editors and a few actors gather to opine on the details of their craft. It is worth a year of film school and at least 1,000 hours of DVD bonus commentary.","Aug 30, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/side-by-side/details
Toy Story 3,A.O. Scott,92,100,"As sweet, as touching, as humane a movie as you are likely to see this summer.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/toy-story-3/details

April and the Extraordinary World,Glenn Kenny,85,100,"Influences aside, the movie so teems with delightful detail and has such an exuberant sense of play that it feels entirely fresh.","Mar 24, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/april-and-the-extraordinary-world/details
Post Tenebras Lux,Manohla Dargis,69,100,"Life and death, nature and culture, sex and money, man and beast, God and the Devil — Post Tenebras Lux embraces the world even if it doesn’t open itself up to ready interpretation.","Apr 30, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/post-tenebras-lux/details
Trophy,Jeannette Catsoulis,80,100,"The intimacy of the film’s images and the surprising candor of its participants are disarming: Whatever your initial response, be prepared to re-evaluate.","Sep  7, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/trophy/details
At Berkeley,Stephen Holden,81,100,"A documentary necessarily conveys a point of view, and although Mr. Wiseman, as is his wont, is neither seen nor heard in a film that proceeds without commentary or subtitles, his spirit is palpable. Without overtly editorializing, the film quietly and steadfastly champions state-funded public education available to all.","Nov  8, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/at-berkeley/details
Tangerine,Manohla Dargis,85,100,"Tangerine encompasses dizzying multitudes — it’s a neo-screwball chase flick with a dash of Rainer Werner Fassbinder — but mostly, movingly, it is a female-friendship movie about two people who each started life with an XY chromosome set.","Jul  9, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tangerine/details
Lady Bird,A.O. Scott,94,100,"You might think you’ve seen this all before. You probably have, but never quite like this. What Ms. Gerwig has done — and it’s by no means a small accomplishment — is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise.","Oct 31, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/details
The Big Short,A.O. Scott,81,100,"A true crime story and a madcap comedy, a heist movie and a scalding polemic, The Big Short will affirm your deepest cynicism about Wall Street while simultaneously restoring your faith in Hollywood.","Dec 10, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-big-short/details

Ransom,Elvis Mitchell,60,100,"Mr. Howard has made Ransom in the same clean, swift, logical style that sent his ""Apollo 13"" into orbit, resulting in a spellbinding crime tale that delivers surprises right down to the wire.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ransom/details
Alexandra,Manohla Dargis,85,100,"A film of startling originality and beauty -- feels like a communiqué from another time, another place, anywhere but here.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/alexandra/details
Life Itself,,87,100,"Life Itself is a work of deftness and delicacy, by turns a film about illness and death, about writing, about cinema and, finally, and very movingly a film about love.","Jul  3, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-itself/details
Hell or High Water,Jeannette Catsoulis,88,100,"Furnished with faces as beaten as the vehicles the brothers drive and discard, Hell or High Water is a chase movie disguised as a western. Its humor is as dry as prairie dust...and its morals are steadfastly gray.","Aug 11, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hell-or-high-water/details
The Kid with a Bike,Manohla Dargis,87,100,A quietly rapturous film about love and redemption.,"Mar 15, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-kid-with-a-bike/details
Ixcanul,Jeannette Catsoulis,83,100,"More than a fable about the clash of tradition and modernity, Ixcanul is finally a painful illustration of the ease with which those who have can prey on those who don’t.","Aug 18, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ixcanul/details
Caucus,Miriam Bale,74,100,The film is a testament to the power of observational documentary to tenderly present hypocrisy and to show eccentricity peeking out from behind social masks.,"Nov  8, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/caucus/details
Brazil,Janet Maslin,88,100,"Brazil may not be the best film of the year, but it's a remarkable accomplishment for Mr. Gilliam, whose satirical and cautionary impulses work beautifully together. His film's ambitious visual style bears this out, combining grim, overpowering architecture with clever throwaway touches.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/brazil/details
Avatar,Manohla Dargis,83,100,Glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/avatar/details
Beasts of the Southern Wild,A.O. Scott,86,100,"This movie is a blast of sheer, improbable joy, a boisterous, thrilling action movie with a protagonist who can hold her own alongside Katniss Everdeen, Princess Merida and the other brave young heroines of 2012.","Jun 26, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/beasts-of-the-southern-wild/details
Sweetgrass,Manohla Dargis,80,100,"In Sweetgrass, a graceful and often moving meditation on a disappearing way of life, there is little here that is objective and much that is magnificent.","Jul  9, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sweetgrass/details
A Ghost Story,A.O. Scott,84,100,"A Ghost Story is suspenseful, dourly funny and at times piercingly emotional.","Jul  6, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-ghost-story/details
The Babadook,A.O. Scott,86,100,"The brilliance of The Babadook, beyond Ms. Kent’s skillful deployment of the tried-and-true visual and aural techniques of movie horror, lies in its interlocking ambiguities.","Nov 28, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-babadook/details
What Now? Remind Me,Jeannette Catsoulis,86,100,"Gentle on the eyes but stirring to the mind, What Now? Remind Me is an extraordinary, almost indescribably personal reflection on life, love, suffering and impermanence.","Aug  7, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/what-now-remind-me/details
Meek's Cutoff,A.O. Scott,85,100,"Meek's Cutoff is as unsentimental and determined as Ms. Williams's character, its absolutely believable heroine. It is also a bracingly original foray into territory that remains, in every sense, unsettled.","Apr  7, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/meeks-cutoff/details

Bridge of Spies,Manohla Dargis,81,100,"Like some of Mr. Spielberg’s other recent movies, notably “Lincoln” and “Munich,” this one is a meticulously detailed period piece that revisits the anxieties of the past while also speaking to those of the present. Yet it also feels lighter than those films, less weighted down by accreted history or maybe by a sense of duty to its significance.","Oct 15, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bridge-of-spies/details
American Graffiti,,97,100,"American Graffiti exists not so much in its individual stories as in its orchestration of many stories, its sense of time and place. Although it is full of the material of fashionable nostalgia, it never exploits nostalgia. In its feeling for movement and music and the vitality of the night—and even in its vision in white—it is oddly closer to some early Fellini than to the recent American past of, say, The Last Picture Show or Summer of '42.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/american-graffiti/details
Embrace of the Serpent,Stephen Holden,82,100,"Viewed largely through the aggrieved eyes of a shaman whose tribe is on the verge of extinction at the hands of Colombian rubber barons in the 19th and 20th centuries, Embrace of the Serpent, a fantastical mixture of myth and historical reality, shatters lingering illusions of first-world culture as more advanced than any other, except technologically.","Feb 18, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/embrace-of-the-serpent/details
Virunga,Jeannette Catsoulis,95,100,"Showcasing the best and the worst in human nature, Orlando von Einsiedel’s devastating documentary “Virunga” wrenches a startlingly lucid narrative from a sickening web of bribery, corruption and violence.","Nov  6, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/virunga/details
Days of Being Wild (re-release),Manohla Dargis,96,100,"As he (Wong Kar-wai) floods the screen with beauty and fills the soundtrack with hypnotic rhythms, he forges a filmmaking style of incomparable eroticism.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/days-of-being-wild-re-release/details

Policeman,Manohla Dargis,79,100,"In Policeman, Mr. Lapid, making an electrifying feature directing debut, traces the line between the group and the individual in a story that can be read as a commentary on the world as much as on Israel.","Jun 12, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/policeman/details
Tower,Manohla Dargis,92,100,"Using a limited frame, Mr. Maitland does his own commemorating, inherently raising questions about terror, the nature of heroism and what it means to really survive. He also does something even more necessary: He turns names on a plaque into people.","Oct 11, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tower/details

High Noon (re-release),Bosley Crowther,89,100,"Meaningful in its implications, as well as loaded with interest and suspense, High Noon is a western to challenge &#147;Stagecoach&#148; for the all-time championship.

Invictus,A.O. Scott,74,100,"It’s an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/invictus/details
Citizen Kane,Bosley Crowther,100,100,"In spite of some disconcerting lapses and strange ambiguities in the creation of the principal character, Citizen Kane is far and away the most surprising and cinematically exciting motion picture to be seen here in many a moon. As a matter of fact, it comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/citizen-kane-1941/details
The Lives of Others,A.O. Scott,89,100,"The easy, complacent distance that informs much historical filmmaking is almost entirely absent from this supremely intelligent, unfailingly honest movie.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lives-of-others/details
The Counselor,Manohla Dargis,48,100,"Mr. Scott’s seriousness isn’t always well served by the scripts he films, but in Mr. McCarthy he has found a partner with convictions about good and evil rather than canned formula.","Oct 24, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-counselor/details

Moonlight,A.O. Scott,99,100,"Moonlight is both a disarmingly, at times almost unbearably personal film and an urgent social document, a hard look at American reality and a poem written in light, music and vivid human faces.","Oct 20, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/moonlight-2016/details
Her,Manohla Dargis,90,100,"At once a brilliant conceptual gag and a deeply sincere romance, Her is the unlikely yet completely plausible love story about a man, who sometimes resembles a machine, and an operating system, who very much suggests a living woman.","Dec 17, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/her/details
Cave of Forgotten Dreams,Manohla Dargis,86,100,"The 3-D is sometimes less than transporting, and the chanting voices in the composer Ernst Reijseger's new-agey score tended to remind me of my last spa massage.

Full Metal Jacket,Vincent Canby,76,100,"Kubrick's harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric new film about Vietnam, is going to puzzle, anger and (I hope) fascinate audiences as much as any film he has made to date... A film of immense and very rare imagination.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/full-metal-jacket/details
Maria Full of Grace,Stephen Holden,87,100,"Sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is offhand.

99 Homes,A.O. Scott,76,100,"If 99 Homes is a scolding look at a society gone astray, it is also a minor masterpiece of suspense, as tightly wound as “Sicario,” Denis Villeneuve’s white-knuckle drug-war thriller, and almost as brutal.","Sep 24, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/99-homes/details

A Christmas Tale,A.O. Scott,84,100,"A movie that is almost indecently satisfying and at the same time elusive, at once intellectually lofty -- marked by allusions to Emerson, Shakespeare and Seamus Heaney as well as Nietzsche -- and as earthy as the passionate provincial family that is its heart and cosmos and reason for being.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-christmas-tale/details
Lone Star,Elvis Mitchell,78,100,"Gratifyingly complex and beautifully told, this tale explores a huge array of cultural, racial, economic and familial tensions.

True Grit,Manohla Dargis,80,100,"In some ways, much like Charles Laughton's ""Night of the Hunter,"" which the Coens quote both musically and visually, True Grit is a parable about good and evil. Only here, the lines between the two are so blurred as to be indistinguishable, making this a true picture of how the West was won, or - depending on your view - lost.","Dec 21, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/true-grit/details
City of Life and Death,Manohla Dargis,85,100,"City of Life and Death isn't cathartic: it offers no uplifting moments, just the immodest balm of art.

The Marquise of O,Vincent Canby,85,100,"It's a dazzling testament to the civilizing effects of several different arts, witty, joyous and so beautiful to look at that it must seem initially suspect to those of us who have begun to respond to spray-painted subway graffiti as the fine art of our time.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-marquise-of-o/details
The Square,A.O. Scott,84,100,"Even though The Square depicts widely covered recent events, it still feels like a revelation.

Listen Up Philip,Manohla Dargis,76,100,"Words do more than hurt, they also slash and burn in this sharp, dyspeptic, sometimes gaspingly funny exploration of art and life, men and women, being and nonbeing, and the power and limits of language.","Oct 16, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/listen-up-philip/details

La Camioneta: The Journey of One American School Bus,Stephen Holden,82,100,"Mark Kendall’s quietly moving documentary, La Camioneta: The Journey of One American School Bus, is as modest and farsighted as its cast of Guatemalans who make a living resurrecting discarded American school buses.","May 30, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-camioneta-the-journey-of-one-american-school-bus/details

Grizzly Man,Manohla Dargis,87,100,"Mr. Herzog is also no ordinary filmmaker. It is the rare documentary like Grizzly Man, which has beauty and passion often lacking in any type of film, that makes you want to grab its maker and head off to the nearest bar to discuss man's domination of nature and how Disney's cute critters reflect our profound alienation from the natural order.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/grizzly-man/details
A Most Violent Year,A.O. Scott,79,100,"J. C.

No Way Out,Vincent Canby,77,100,"No Way Out has the exuberance of something freshly conceived.

Ida,A.O. Scott,91,100,"There is an implicit argument here between faith and materialism, one that is resolved with wit, conviction and generosity of spirit.

Land of the Dead,Manohla Dargis,71,100,"One of the enormous pleasures of genre filmmaking is watching great directors push against form and predictability, as Mr. Romero does brilliantly in Land of the Dead.

Glengarry Glen Ross,Vincent Canby,80,100,"The reason the film prompts laughter, and finally elation, is not because it's jolly or has any feel-good words to live by.

Breaking Away,Janet Maslin,91,100,"The cast is unknown, the director has a spotty history, and the basic premise falls into this year's most hackneyed category (unknown boxer/ bowler/jogger hopes to become sports hero).

Ran,Vincent Canby,96,100,"Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, ''Ran'' has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ran-re-release/details
Cameraperson,A.O. Scott,86,100,"Cameraperson isn’t a work of journalism or advocacy. It’s a scrapbook, a found poem assembled out of scraps and snippets of truth. And it is, above all, an act of showing rather than telling.","Sep  8, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cameraperson/details

Lebanon,A.O.

Hot Tub Time Machine,A.O. Scott,63,100,"The movie itself is a nonstop barrage -- somewhere between a riot and an orgy -- of crude, obnoxious gags and riffs.

35 Shots of Rum,A.O.

King Kong,Dana Stevens,81,100,"The rapport between Ms. Watts and Mr. Serkis is extraordinary, even though it is mediated by fur, latex, optical illusions and complicated effects.

My Perestroika,Stephen Holden,90,100,My Perestroika gives you a privileged sense of learning the history of a place not from a book but from the people who lived it.

The Fits,Manohla Dargis,90,100,"The miracle of the movie is that, like Toni, it transcends blunt, reductive categorization partly because it’s free of political sloganeering, finger wagging and force-fed lessons.

The Lobster,A.O. Scott,82,100,"Cruelty and humor are nestled like spoons in a drawer. Mr. Lanthimos’s method is to elicit an appreciative chuckle followed by a gasp of shock, and to deliver violence and whimsy in the same even tone. “The Lobster” is often startlingly funny in the way it proposes its surreal conceits, and then upsettingly grim in the way it follows through on them.","May 12, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lobster/details

BPM (Beats Per Minute),A.O. Scott,85,100,"in spite of its historical specificity, BPM never feels like a bulletin from the past.

Aquarius,A.O. Scott,88,100,"Aquarius is a marvelous and surprising act of portraiture, a long, unhurried encounter with a single, complicated person.

Reversal of Fortune,Vincent Canby,93,100,"What makes it so instructively entertaining is the pivotal character of Claus von Bulow, played by Jeremy Irons within an inch of his professional life.

Frances Ha,A.O. Scott,82,100,"With its swift, jaunty rhythms and sharp, off-kilter jokes, Frances Ha is frequently delightful.

Malcolm X,Vincent Canby,72,100,"Mr. Lee means for Malcolm X to be an epic, and it is in its concerns and its physical scope.

Elle,A.O. Scott,89,100,"It’s a psychological thriller, a strangely dry-eyed melodrama, a kinky sex farce and, perhaps most provocatively, a savage comedy of bourgeois manners.

The Untouchables,Vincent Canby,79,100,"Hollywood's latest big-budget, high-concept, mass-market reworking of material not entirely fresh, has more endings than Beethoven's Fifth, but it's also packed with surprises, not the least being that it's a smashing work.

Raging Bull,Vincent Canby,92,100,"The entire film is played at such high pitch it may well exhaust audiences that don't come prepared.

Raging Bull is an achievement.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/raging-bull/details

The Grifters,Vincent Canby,86,100,"The Grifters moves with swift unsentimental resolve toward a last act as bleak as any in recent American screen literature.

There Will Be Blood,Manohla Dargis,93,100,"The film is above all a consummate work of art, one that transcends the historically fraught context of its making, and its pleasures are unapologetically aesthetic.

Letters from Iwo Jima,A.O. Scott,89,100,"A few scenes serve as hinges joining this movie to ""Flags of Our Fathers.""

Pieta,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,100,"Morally cunning and with a tone as black as pitch, Pieta, the 18th film from the South Korean director Kim Ki-duk, is a deeply unnerving revenge movie in which redemption is dangled like a cat toy before a cougar.","May 16, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pieta/details
Lantana,Dana Stevens,84,100,"Astonishingly well acted film, so much so that it seems unfair to single out any of the performances. Mr. Lawrence's camera sense is as sure and unobtrusive as his feel for acting.

Ghost World,Dana Stevens,88,100,"It's surely the best depiction of teenage eccentricity since ""Rushmore,"" and its incisive satire of the boredom and conformity that rule our thrill-seeking, individualistic land, and also its question-mark ending, reminded me of ""The Graduate.""",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ghost-world/details

Citizenfour,A.O. Scott,88,100,"Cinema, even in the service of journalism, is always more than reporting, and focusing on what Ms. Poitras’s film is about risks ignoring what it is. It’s a tense and frightening thriller that blends the brisk globe-trotting of the “Bourne” movies with the spooky, atmospheric effects of a Japanese horror film. And it is also a primal political fable for the digital age, a real-time tableau of the confrontation between the individual and the state.","Oct 23, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/citizenfour/details

James White,Stephen Holden,83,100,Its abrasive portrait of contemporary New York as a place of noise and nerve-rattling turmoil captures the mood of the city more accurately than any recent film I can think of.

10 Cloverfield Lane,Jeannette Catsoulis,76,100,"Sneakily tweaking our fears of terrorism, 10 Cloverfield Lane, though no more than a kissing cousin to its namesake, is smartly chilling and finally spectacular.","Mar 10, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/10-cloverfield-lane/details
Steve Jobs,A.O. Scott,82,100,"Steve Jobs is a rich and potent document of the times, an expression of both the awe that attends sophisticated new consumer goods and the unease that trails in the wake of their arrival.... Mostly, though, it is a formally audacious, intellectually energized entertainment, a powerful challenge to the lazy conventions of Hollywood storytelling and a feast for connoisseurs of contemporary screen acting.","Oct  8, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/steve-jobs/details
Jane Eyre,A.O. Scott,76,100,"A splendid example of how to tackle the daunting duty of turning a beloved work of classic literature into a movie.

Boyhood,Manohla Dargis,100,100,"In Boyhood, Mr. Linklater’s masterpiece, he both captures moments in time and relinquishes them as he moves from year to year.

Carol,A.O. Scott,95,100,"At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, Carol is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros.

Project X,Neil Genzlinger,48,100,"The Oscars are swell, but once in a while a film comes along that is so courageous it deserves consideration for the Nobel Prize.

Les Destinées,Dana Stevens,73,100,"Like a good novel, Les Destinées is many things: a family chronicle, a series of psychological portraits, a sumptuous re-creation of the past.

Last Train Home,A.O. Scott,86,100,"Mr. Fan's documentary is informed by a melancholy humanism, and finds unexpected beauty in almost unbearably harsh circumstances. It tells the story of a family caught, and possibly crushed, between the past and the future - a story that, on its own, is moving, even heartbreaking. Multiplied by 130 million, it becomes a terrifying and sobering panorama of the present.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/last-train-home/details
The Deep Blue Sea,A.O. Scott,82,100,"To put the matter perhaps more abstractly than such a sensual film deserves, it is about the fate of untameable, irrational desire in a world that does not seem to have a place for it.","Mar 22, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-deep-blue-sea/details
Rango,A.O. Scott,75,100,"Rango, which may take place entirely within its hero's head - that kind of ambiguity worked in ""Inception"" and ""Black Swan,"" so why not here? - is about the appetite for myths and stories, whether or not they make sense.

"Synecdoche, New York",Manohla Dargis,67,100,"To say that Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York is one of the best films of the year or even one closest to my heart is such a pathetic response to its soaring ambition that I might as well pack it in right now.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/synecdoche-new-york/details
Ratatouille,A.O. Scott,96,100,"A nearly flawless piece of popular art, as well as one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film.

Inside Llewyn Davis,A.O. Scott,93,100,"This is not a biopic, it’s a Coen brothers movie, which is to say a brilliant magpie’s nest of surrealism, period detail and pop-culture scholarship.

Three Colors: Red,Janet Maslin,100,100,"Red succeeds so stirringly that it also bestows some much-needed magic upon its predecessors, ""Blue"" and ""White.""

The Turin Horse,A.O. Scott,80,100,"The movie is too beautiful to be described as an ordeal, but it is sufficiently intense and unyielding that when it is over, you may feel, along with awe, a measure of relief.

Casablanca,Bosley Crowther,100,100,"The Warners here have a picture which makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap. For once more, as in recent Bogart pictures, they have turned the incisive trick of draping a tender love story within the folds of a tight topical theme. They have used Mr. Bogart's personality, so well established in other brilliant films, to inject a cold point of tough resistance to evil forces afoot in Europe today. And they have so combined sentiment, humor and pathos with taut melodrama and bristling intrigue that the result is a highly entertaining and even inspiring film.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/casablanca/details

The Wound,Glenn Kenny,80,100,"Mr. Trengove shoots the film in intimate wide-screen, getting in close to the performers as their characters tamp down explosive feelings, often letting the spectacular landscapes behind them break down into soft-focus abstractions.

In the Fog,Manohla Dargis,78,100,"Mr. Loznitsa doesn’t lighten the mood with any familiar filmmaking tricks: there are, for instance, no musical cues to guide you over the troubling or ambiguous passages.

An Art That Nature Makes: The Work of Rosamond Purcell,A.O.

American Hustle,Manohla Dargis,90,100,"Mr. Bale, like some other stars who embrace playing ugly, feels as if he’d been liberated by all the pounds he’s packed on and by his character’s molting looks, an emancipation that’s most evident in his delicately intimate, moving moments with Ms. Adams and Ms. Lawrence.","Dec 12, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/american-hustle/details
It's Such a Beautiful Day,Neil Genzlinger,90,100,"Considering that he’s a stick figure, Bill, the main character in It’s Such a Beautiful Day, sure does have a complex internal life.

Anna Karenina,A.O. Scott,63,100,"Mr. Wright's Anna Karenina is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly - wonderfully - crazy terms.","Nov 15, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/anna-karenina/details

I Am Not Your Negro,A.O.

You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet,A.O. Scott,69,90,"You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet is a sly, elegant meditation on the relationship between reality and artifice. But it is a thought-experiment driven above all by emotion.","Jun  6, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/you-aint-seen-nothin-yet/details

A Simple Life,Rachel Saltz,78,90,"Ms. Hui, a rare successful female director in the Hong Kong film industry, drew her story from real events, and the movie retains a tonic flavor of the everyday: its drama unfolds simply, without explosive moments but not without emotion.

Winter's Bone,A.O. Scott,90,90,"The film's realism is a point of entry rather than the whole point of the exercise.

Cadillac Records,A.O. Scott,65,90,"This movie is crowded and sprawling, and if it rambles sometimes, that's just fine.

My Cousin Vinny,Vincent Canby,68,90,"My Cousin Vinny is easily the most inventive and enjoyable American film farce in a long time, even during those extended patches when it seems to be marking time or when it continues with a running gag that can't stay the distance.

Masculine Feminine (re-release),Dana Stevens,92,90,"This document of youthful confusion has not aged one minute.

SubUrbia,Elvis Mitchell,62,90,"Mr. Bogosian's venomously funny play, which he adapted himself for the screen, is given warmth and generosity by Mr. Linklater, whose elegantly fluid direction and great skill with actors are accentuated by the play's spareness.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/suburbia/details

The Lost City of Z,Manohla Dargis,78,90,"There’s much to love in this film, but what lingers are those lapidary details that often go missing in stories about great men, as if they had built the world alone and no child had ever raced down a road waving goodbye as a father disappeared into history.","Apr 13, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lost-city-of-z/details
A Serious Man,A.O. Scott,79,90,"The story is at once hilarious and horrific, its significance both self-evident and opaque.

Little Children,A.O.

Beach Rats,Ben Kenigsberg,78,90,"The back-and-forths of the character’s decisions feel real, and Mr. Dickinson’s laconic blankness (you would never guess the actor was British) helps to give the character’s existential crisis a charge.

Things to Come,A.O.

Our Children,Manohla Dargis,79,90,"Much like the Dardennes, Mr. Joachim holds to the truth that the personal is political, which is why this isn’t simply a movie about a woman and an unspeakable crime, but also an exploration of the power and cruelty that brought her to that very dark place.","Aug  1, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/our-children/details

The Last Mountain,Jeannette Catsoulis,62,90,"If Mr. Haney sometimes struggles to find focus, he has no trouble locating heroes, including the doggedly energetic Robert F.

Once Upon a Time in Anatolia,Manohla Dargis,82,90,"A metaphysical road movie about life, death and the limits of knowledge, Once Upon a Time in Anatolia has arrived just in time to cure the adult filmgoer blues.","Jan  3, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/once-upon-a-time-in-anatolia/details
The Agronomist,Dana Stevens,82,90,"It seems almost unthinkable that such a charismatic, generous and lively man could be gone. It also makes you understand what it means for a country like Haiti to lose a citizen like Jean Dominique.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-agronomist/details
Loving,Manohla Dargis,79,90,"Mr. Nichols’s most distinct aesthetic choice is the movie’s quietness and the hush that envelops its first scene and that eventually defines the Lovings as much as their accents, gestures, manners and battles.","Nov  3, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/loving/details
Rush,Manohla Dargis,75,90,"Mr. Howard doesn’t just want you to crawl inside a Formula One racecar, he also wants you to crawl inside its driver’s head.","Sep 19, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rush/details
I Love You Phillip Morris,Stephen Holden,65,90,"A Jim Carrey movie all the way: a good one, I might add.

Black Death,Jeannette Catsoulis,71,90,"Here, excessive piety and rampant paganism are equally malevolent forces, the film's baleful view of human nature mirrored in Sebastian Edschmid's swampy photography. As is emphasized in a nicely consistent coda, the Lord's side and the right side are not necessarily one and the same.","Mar 10, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-death/details

Premium Rush,Manohla Dargis,66,90,"Stuffed with zingers and zippy stunts, it comes with pretty young things of all hues and hair types - few prettier than its lead, Joseph Gordon-Levitt - and start-to-finish clever special effects, none more clever or special than Michael Shannon.","Aug 23, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/premium-rush/details
Mountains May Depart,Manohla Dargis,79,90,"Mr. Jia’s approach means that you have to do a certain amount of interpretive work, though mostly you just have to pay attention and be a little patient. If you do, you will notice that Mountains May Depart is a movie of threes: its main characters, moments in time, narrative sections, historical symbols and even aspect ratio come in triplicate.","Feb 11, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mountains-may-depart/details
Miles Ahead,Manohla Dargis,64,90,"Does it matter that stretches of Miles Ahead — a gun-rattling, squealing-tire car chase included — came out of the filmmakers’ imagination rather than Davis’s life?

Lawless Heart,Dana Stevens,75,90,"By allowing the stories to play off one another and allowing layers of meaning to accumulate before we even notice them, the filmmakers capture some of the essential strangeness of life -- the way our relations are governed by laws that remain invisible to us until art reveals their workings.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lawless-heart/details
Lilya 4-Ever,Stephen Holden,82,90,The most remarkable achievement of the film is its presentation of Lilya's story as both an archetypal case study and a personal drama whose spunky central character you come to care about so deeply that you want to cry out a warning at each step toward her ruination.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lilya-4-ever/details

The Prison in Twelve Landscapes,Jeannette Catsoulis,86,90,"Ms. Story’s unconventional approach provokes responses that a traditional facts-and-figures discussion might not.

Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,Jeannette Catsoulis,84,90,"Visually distinctive and aurally delightful, ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"" has style to burn.

Our Time Will Come,Andy Webster,82,90,"It’s Fang’s transformation, embodied by Ms. Zhou’s lean, cool authority, that carries the most weight, lending the proceedings an unforced feminist dimension, and reaffirming Ms. Hui’s status as one of China’s cinematic treasures.","Jul  6, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/our-time-will-come/details

Get On Up,Stephen Holden,71,90,"Like its gyrating, spasmodic staccato beats, Get On Up refuses to stand still.

28 Weeks Later,A.O. Scott,78,90,"28 Weeks Later is not for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach. It is brutal and almost exhaustingly terrifying, as any respectable zombie movie should be.

Window Horses,Teo Bugbee,82,90,"At first, Rosie’s simplicity is jarring.

The First Beautiful Thing,Neil Genzlinger,62,90,"Comedy and poignancy weave together in Mr. Virzì's hands, but the maudlin meter only occasionally goes into the red zone.

Black Orpheus,Bosley Crowther,81,90,"It really is not the two lovers that are the focus of interest in this film; it is the music, the movement, the storm of color that go into the two-day festival.

Eve's Bayou,Stephen Holden,78,90,"Louisiana's delta country has never looked more darkly, lusciously sensual than it does in Eve's Bayou, a Southern gothic soap opera, written and directed by Kasi Lemmons, that transcends the genre through the sheer rumbling force of its characters' passions.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/eves-bayou/details

Battle for Brooklyn,Neil Genzlinger,71,90,"A documentary about the unending mess that is the Atlantic Yards project, is unabashedly slanted and as a result will probably be dismissed by those it portrays unflatteringly.

This optimistic film lacks the outrage of the earlier work, but that's O.K. A movement needs its triumphs too.","Oct 20, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/revenge-of-the-electric-car/details
Dementia,Neil Genzlinger,64,90,"It’s an assured, deftly acted movie that builds its creepiness slowly and keeps its secrets well hidden till the end.","Dec  3, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dementia/details
Kung Fu Panda,Manohla Dargis,73,90,"At once fuzzy-wuzzy and industrial strength, the tacky-sounding Kung Fu Panda is high concept with a heart.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kung-fu-panda/details

Bikes vs Cars,Andy Webster,68,90,"Breezy, intelligent, diffuse but uncluttered, Fredrik Gertten’s documentary Bikes vs Cars could be called a tale of congestion-plagued cities.","Dec  3, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bikes-vs-cars/details
Animal Kingdom,Stephen Holden,83,90,"The film's depiction of the raw fear lurking below the brothers' braggadocio is the most pronounced emotion in a movie whose focus on the personalities of its criminals suggests an Australian answer to ""Goodfellas,"" minus the wise-guy humor.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/animal-kingdom/details
The Yellow Sea,Manohla Dargis,70,90,"A rush of a movie from South Korea that slips and slides from horror to humor on rivers of blood and offers the haunting image of a man, primitive incarnate, beating other men with an enormous, gnawed-over meat bone.","Dec  1, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-yellow-sea/details
Jason Becker: Not Dead Yet,Neil Genzlinger,70,90,"This heartfelt documentary is also, more subtly, a tribute to the squadron of caregivers that has enabled Mr. Becker not only to survive for an extraordinarily long time but also to continue to compose music, using virtually the only part of him that still moves, his eyes.","Dec 13, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jason-becker-not-dead-yet/details

Operation Avalanche,Jeannette Catsoulis,69,90,"There’s a headlong temerity to Mr. Johnson’s style that places the dippy thrill of moviemaking front and center, revealing a director (and a character) so high on his power to misrepresent reality that a future in politics seems all but assured.","Sep 15, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/operation-avalanche/details
Happy-Go-Lucky,Manohla Dargis,84,90,"Mr. Leigh has never been an artist for whom happy (word or idea) has been an easy fit.

The Leopard (re-release),Bosley Crowther,100,90,"For the most part, Nino Rota's music provides a rich melodic surrounding for the pictorial magnificence, and a heretofore unknown Verdi waltz that is played at the ball at the finish appropriately supplements this remarkably vivid, panoramic, and eventually morbid show.

The Boxer,Elvis Mitchell,75,90,"Mr. Day-Lewis, looking wearily rugged and battling his way through several plausible boxing matches, once again breathes fire into the character of a high-minded loner, and his vitality lends real force to the film's moral arguments.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-boxer/details

You Hurt My Feelings,Jeannette Catsoulis,tbd,90,"Unfolding in New England over four vibrantly represented seasons, ""Feelings"" is a small-scale wonder.

The Last Detail,Vincent Canby,89,90,"The Last Detail is one superbly funny, uproariously intelligent performance, plus two others that are very, very good, which are so effectively surrounded by profound bleakness that it seems to be a new kind of anti-comedy.

Starred Up,A.O. Scott,81,90,"Though it is, finally, an affecting story of two damaged men bound by blood and something like love (and also a thrillerish catalog of double crosses and shifting allegiances), it is, above all, a study in the patterns of chaos that govern penitentiary life.","Aug 26, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/starred-up/details
Lorenzo's Oil,Janet Maslin,80,90,"As directed by George Miller, this film has an appealingly brisk, unsentimental style and a rare ability to compress and convey detailed medical data. It also displays tremendous compassion for all three Odones and what they have been through.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lorenzos-oil/details
The Survivalist,Jeannette Catsoulis,80,90,"Impressively lean and rigidly controlled, “The Survivalist” achieves, at times, the primitive allure of a silent movie.","May 18, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-survivalist/details
Hadewijch,Stephen Holden,83,90,"If Hadewijch is Mr. Dumont's most overtly religious film, it is not pro-faith in any specific way, although the director clearly respects the religious impulse.","Dec 25, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hadewijch/details

Wonderstruck,Manohla Dargis,72,90,"Mr. Selznick’s emphasis on wonder...can feel bullying, as if he were demanding delight instead of earning it. Yet even as he follows Mr. Selznick’s narrative lead, Mr. Haynes quietly and touchingly makes Wonderstruck his own because the wonder of the film isn’t in its story but in its telling.","Oct 19, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/wonderstruck/details

Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion [re-release],Vincent Canby,89,90,"Although Mr. Petri quite consciously makes movies about ideas, he has, in his ""Investigation,"" made a movie in which the ideas, and the man who seethes with them, have the shock and impact of the most fundamental kind of melodrama.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/investigation-of-a-citizen-above-suspicion-re-release/details

Shadow Dancer,Stephen Holden,71,90,"The movie takes no political positions. With an icy detachment, it peers through the fog of war and examines the slippery military intelligence on both sides to portray a world steeped in secrecy, deception and paranoia.","May 30, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/shadow-dancer/details
Keep On Keepin' On,A.O. Scott,77,90,"Like other stories of musical tutelage, Keep On Keepin’ On is ultimately an examination of the pursuit of greatness.

Lake Tahoe,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,90,"Exquisitely captured in natural light by the cinematographer Alexis Zabé, Juan’s journey is framed by sherbet-colored houses and lemon sidewalks, dipping palm fronds and a burnished, turquoise horizon. The director calls his style ""artisan cinema""; I just call it dreamy.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lake-tahoe/details
A Time to Kill,Elvis Mitchell,54,90,"If the film doesn't add up to a cogent legal argument, neither does it have trouble delivering 2 hours and 20 minutes' worth of sturdy, highly charged drama.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-time-to-kill/details
Ballast,Manohla Dargis,84,90,"Shot with a sure hand and a cast of unknowns, the film doesn't so much tell a story as develop a tone and root around a place that, despite the intimate camerawork, remains shrouded in ambiguity.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ballast/details
Sunset Song,Stephen Holden,72,90,"Like most of Mr. Davies’s films, Sunset Song makes you see the world through his sorrowful eyes. He is a die-hard romantic, whose acute sensitivity to the passage of time conveys a bittersweet awareness of the fragility of beauty, which, for him, is synonymous with melancholy.","May 12, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sunset-song/details
Father of My Children,Manohla Dargis,76,90,"A tale of cinema, a story about the agonies of trying to work outside the cinematic mainstream (even in France!). Yet what makes the movie so affecting is that it’s also a love story about a family.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/father-of-my-children/details
True Lies,Caryn James,63,90,Much of the appeal of True Lies comes from the smooth grafting of battle-of-the-sexes comedy onto a high-tech action picture.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/true-lies/details

The Family Jams,Andy Webster,tbd,90,"The low-key, hand-held Family Jams may not ever attain the stature of, say, a concert film like D. A. Pennebaker's ""Don't Look Back."" But it should, as a record of musicians in youthful flower, sharing a loose, heartfelt camaraderie and lack of pretension.","Apr  7, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-family-jams/details
The Deep End,A.O. Scott,78,90,"Fastidious and smart, and Ms. Swinton's fixated intensity isn't ever remote; we're always aware of how deeply she's feeling. Her work is magnificent.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-deep-end/details
Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry,Manohla Dargis,81,90,"The fluidity and convenience of digital moviemaking tools explain some of its freshness, as does Ms. Klayman's history as a budding documentarian. It's clear from watching both the feature and its earlier iterations that, while she was learning about Mr. Ai, she was also learning how to tell a visual story. It's easy to think that hanging around Mr. Ai, a brilliant Conceptual artist and an equally great mass-media interpolater, played a part in her education.","Jul 26, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ai-weiwei-never-sorry/details
Kramer vs. Kramer,Vincent Canby,77,90,"Kramer vs. Kramer is densely packed with such beautifully observed detail. It is also superbly acted by its supporting cast, including Jane Alexander, Howard Duff and George Coe.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kramer-vs-kramer/details
The Secret in Their Eyes,Manohla Dargis,80,90,"An attractive, messy drama riddled with violence and edged with comedy that comes with a hint of Grand Guignol, a suggestion of politics and three resonant, deeply appealing performances.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-secret-in-their-eyes/details
Kati with an I,Jeannette Catsoulis,81,90,"Buoyed by a fully integrated soundtrack, Kati With an I delivers a lovingly personal observation of young people at a crossroads. The film's sound is not always crisp, but no matter: Kati's story is written in every vital, vérité frame.","Apr  7, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kati-with-an-i/details
Dark Shadows,Manohla Dargis,55,90,"Dark Shadows isn't among Mr. Burton's most richly realized works, but it's very enjoyable, visually sumptuous and, despite its lugubrious source material and a sporadic tremor of violence, surprisingly effervescent.","May 10, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dark-shadows/details
Weekend,A.O. Scott,81,90,"There is also a need for stories that address the complex entanglements of love and sex honestly, without sentiment or cynicism and with the appropriate mixture of humor, sympathy and erotic heat. Weekend, Andrew Haigh's astonishingly self-assured, unassumingly profound second feature, is just such a film.","Sep 22, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/weekend/details
The Pirogue,A.O. Scott,74,90,"The most powerful thing about The Pirogue is the way it deals with emotionally charged events matter-of-factly, rather than melodramatically. The story Mr. Touré has chosen to tell is both painfully specific - about these individuals, in this boat - and immeasurably vast, since the experience it depicts is shared by millions of people around the world. And yet somehow he gets the scale just right.","Jan 22, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-pirogue/details
Gran Torino,Manohla Dargis,72,90,"Mr. Eastwood is also an adept director of his own performances and, perhaps more important, a canny manipulator of his own iconographic presence.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gran-torino/details
The Blue Room,Manohla Dargis,73,90,"Mr. Amalric, who directed this dark, delectable, shivery tale, adapting it from the Georges Simenon novel, sets its uneasy, dank mood with energetic economy.","Oct  2, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-blue-room/details
This Is England,Manohla Dargis,86,90,"A modest, near-flawless gem, This Is England is the fifth feature by the young British director Shane Meadows, doing his best work since he first hit the festival scene in the mid-1990s with his hilarious, raw-hewn shorts “Small Time.”",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/this-is-england/details

Love & Friendship,A.O. Scott,87,90,"At times, most often when Mr. Bennett is onscreen, Love & Friendship is howlingly funny, and as a whole it feels less like a romance than like a caper, an unabashedly contrived and effortlessly inventive heist movie with a pretty good payoff.","May 12, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/details
The Silence of the Lambs,Vincent Canby,85,90,"All sorts of macabre things have gone on, and are still going on just offscreen, in Jonahan Demme's swift, witty new suspence thriller.[14 February 1991]",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-silence-of-the-lambs/details

The Merry Gentleman,Manohla Dargis,55,90,"The film’s title, needless to say, has an ironic bite. One of the pleasures of The Merry Gentleman is Mr. Keaton's commitment to that bite, which never registers as cruel or gratuitous, just honest, weary, sad.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-merry-gentleman/details
"Good Bye, Dragon Inn",Dana Stevens,82,90,"Has a quiet, cumulative magic, whose source is hard to identify. Its simple, meticulously composed frames are full of mystery and feeling; it's an action movie that stands perfectly still.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/good-bye-dragon-inn/details

Iris,Manohla Dargis,80,90,"What is clear is that while there are several stories folded into Iris — a marriage tale, an ode to multiculturalism and a fashion spectacular — it is also about the insistent rejection of monocultural conformity.","Apr 28, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/iris-2015/details
Step Up To The Plate,David DeWitt,68,90,"What resonates here are two men, two good men, whose lives have a paradoxically simple and complex bond beyond their profession.

Fences,A.O. Scott,79,90,Even as it properly foregrounds Wilson’s dialogue — few playwrights have approached his genius for turning workaday vernacular into poetry — Fences is much more than a filmed reading.

Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan,A.O. Scott,74,90,"Mongol -- or, as I prefer to think of it, ""Genghis Khan: The Early Years"" -- is a big, ponderous epic, its beautifully composed landscape shots punctuated by thundering hooves and bloody, slow-motion battle sequences.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mongol-the-rise-of-genghis-khan/details

5 Broken Cameras,A.O. Scott,78,90,"5 Broken Cameras deserves to be appreciated for the lyrical delicacy of his voice and the precision of his eye.

Amy,Manohla Dargis,85,90,"With Amy, Mr. Kapadia isn’t simply revisiting Ms. Winehouse’s life and death, but also — by pulling you in close to her, first pleasantly and then unpleasantly — telling the story of contemporary celebrity and, crucially, fandom’s cost.","Jul  2, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/amy-2015/details

The Class,Manohla Dargis,92,90,"Here Mr. Cantet -- whose earlier features include ""Human Resources"" and ""Time Out,"" two other dramas about systems of power -- has done that rarest of things in movies about children: He has allowed them to talk.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-class/details

Dear White People,A.O. Scott,79,90,"You want to see this movie, and you will want to talk about it afterward, even if the conversation feels a little awkward. If it doesn’t, you’re doing it wrong.

Hard to Be a God,Nicolas Rapold,90,90,"Mr. German was just as stubborn in sticking to his personal vision (and revisions) as he was innovative in his storytelling, and he’s left behind a final opus that is hard to shake.","Jan 29, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hard-to-be-a-god/details
Blank City,A.O. Scott,70,90,"Ms. Danhier manages to conjure a glorious and grungy bygone past without fetishizing it as a golden age. A bunch of people got together and did some stuff, and this is what it looked like.","Apr  6, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blank-city/details
The To Do List,Neil Genzlinger,61,90,"This movie is smarter and better acted and just plain funnier than most of its predecessors in the my-first-time genre, no matter which sex is losing what.","Jul 25, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-to-do-list/details
Diner,Janet Maslin,86,90,"Diner isn't lavish or long, but it's the sort of small, honest, entertaining movie that should never go out of style, even in an age of sequels and extravaganzas.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/diner/details

The Hunter,Stephen Holden,76,90,"The clammy chill that pervades The Hunter, the fourth feature film by the Iranian director Rafi Pitts, seeps under your skin as you wait for its grim, taciturn protagonist to detonate.","Jan  3, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hunter/details
A Quiet Passion,A.O.

Reality,Manohla Dargis,76,90,"Reality is a story about one man’s desire to make it big on the small screen, and something of a familiar exploration of the blurring between reality and its simulations. More elliptically and more interestingly, it is also a look at an Italy engrossed with rituals and spectacle, in watching and being watched.","Mar 14, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/reality/details
We Have a Pope,Manohla Dargis,64,90,"Mr. Moretti finds broad comedy in the antics of some clerics, who can seem as sweet as children, but in Melville there is pathos and there is tragedy, and not his alone.","Apr  5, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/we-have-a-pope/details

Sully,Manohla Dargis,74,90,"The movie is economical and solid, and generally low-key when it’s not freaking you out. That it unnerves you as much as it does may seem surprising, given that going in, we know how this story ends.

Bachelorette,Stephen Holden,53,90,"Bachelorette is more tartly written, better acted and less forgiving than male-centric equivalents like the ""Hangover"" movies.","Sep  6, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bachelorette/details
Papirosen,Jeannette Catsoulis,80,90,"But instead of a dignified stroll down genealogy lane, Mr. Solnicki has made a sparking, gossipy soap opera that’s riddled with emotion and stuffed with strong characters.","Jan 23, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/papirosen/details
Anita,Miriam Bale,68,90,"Anita is an important historical document about an event that prompted a larger cultural conversation about sexual harassment.

Me You Them,Dana Stevens,66,90,"An unexpected delight, a film that weds the humor and magic of a folk tale with a very modern feel for the psychological dynamics between men and women and for the subtle politics of male rivalry in a macho culture. It has been made and acted with intelligence and evident love, which deserves to be requited.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/me-you-them/details
Tears of Gaza,Jeannette Catsoulis,69,90,"Woven together, these monologues of bereavement and confusion, illustrated with images so terrible they repel rational explanation, form a tapestry of human misery that's impossible to shake off.","Sep 19, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tears-of-gaza/details
Turtles Can Fly,A.O. Scott,85,90,"It is a heartbreaking film, and cruelty sometimes seems to be not only its subject but its method. Like the child on a high cliff that is one of its recurring images, the film walks up to the edge of hopelessness and pauses there, waiting to see what happens next.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/turtles-can-fly/details

Rain,Dana Stevens,71,90,"The visual beauty of the film, rather than distracting from the troubling story, makes it more troubling still.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rain/details
Amanda Knox,Jeannette Catsoulis,78,90,"The directors, Brian McGinn and Rod Blackhurst, have produced a tightly edited, coherently structured and ultimately moving reassessment that burrows beneath the lurid in search of the illuminating.","Sep 29, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/amanda-knox/details
Keep the Lights On,A.O.

Paths of the Soul,Glenn Kenny,90,90,"The movie so upends the traditions of documentary and narrative filmmaking that “dramatizes” may be inaccurate — the filmmakers followed the real pilgrims for a full year, after all.

The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu,Manohla Dargis,87,90,"In many respects Ceausescu turns out to be as much the author of this brilliant documentary as the director, Andrei Ujica, who waded through more than 1,000 hours of filmed state propaganda, official news reports and home movies to create a cinematic tour de force that tracks the rise, reign and grim fall of its subject.","Sep  8, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-autobiography-of-nicolae-ceausescu/details
Inland Empire,Manohla Dargis,72,90,"One of the few films I've seen this year that deserves to be called art.

Out 1: Noli Me Tangere (1971),Glenn Kenny,87,90,"What plays out is a cinematic experience of life as performance, performance as life, reality as a construction and reality as someone else’s construction impinging on your own. The pace, which picks up and slows down throughout, is not some kind of perverse challenge to the audience.

Our Little Sister,A.O. Scott,75,90,"Seeming to wander through small incidents and mundane busyness, it acquires momentum and dramatic weight through a brilliant kind of narrative stealth.

In Jackson Heights,Manohla Dargis,81,90,"Over time, as the movie returns to specific spaces, touching on human rights and gentrification along the way, it develops into a deeply stirring ode to the immigrant experience and American identity.","Nov  3, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-jackson-heights/details
In the Family,,82,90,"Mr. Wang's slow-reveal psychological drama isn't just a showcase for his excellent ensemble cast.

When I Walk,Jeannette Catsoulis,80,90,"Astonishingly, this is neither as depressing nor as arm-twistingly uplifting as you might expect.

Demon,Manohla Dargis,80,90,"Mr. Wrona is very good at thickening the air with mystery, and right from the start he slips in enigmatic details and figures — the prowling bulldozer, a keening woman, a scowling man — that disturb the ordinary scene.

The We and the I,A.O. Scott,65,90,"To call this thrillingly original, deeply felt movie a coming-of-age story would be to insult it with cliché.

The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans,A.O. Scott,69,90,"Mr. Herzog’s film is a pulpy, glorious mess.

The Arbor,Jeannette Catsoulis,88,90,"Like a Ken Loach drama stripped to bare bones, The Arbor springs to life in the bright bitterness of Dunbar's prose, showcased in alfresco performances of contentious scenes from the play.","Apr 27, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-arbor/details
King Jack,Helen T. Verongos,72,90,"For everyone who ever had a close call as an adolescent and kept it from the grown-ups, King Jack will hit you where you live.

A Woman Is a Woman,Dana Stevens,71,90,"It is the work of a master -- of more than one, for that matter.

Assault on Precinct 13,Vincent Canby,89,90,"Assault on Precinct 13 is a much more complex film than Mr. Carpenter's Halloween, though it's not really about anything more complicated than a scare down the spine. A lot of its eerie power comes from the kind of unexplained, almost supernatural events one expects to find in a horror movie but not in a melodrama of this sort.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/assault-on-precinct-13-1976/details

World Trade Center,Dana Stevens,66,90,"Mr. Stone has taken a public tragedy and turned it into something at once genuinely stirring and terribly sad.

Visitors,Stephen Holden,62,90,"Time slows to a near-standstill as the film peers into humanity’s troubled soul, glimpsed through the individual faces, which sometimes appear to be studying us as intently as we are studying them.","Jan 23, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/visitors/details

Medicine for Melancholy,A.O. Scott,63,90,"There are no simple answers or obvious conclusions to be gleaned from this movie, which, like its soundtrack, is both sad and vibrant, meandering and formally sure-footed.

ParaNorman,Manohla Dargis,72,90,"Far more than Norman's adventure, which takes him from home to a cemetery and deep into his town's history, what pulls you in, quickening your pulse and widening your eyes, are the myriad visual enchantments - from the rich, nubby tactility of his clothes to the skull-and-bones adorning his bedroom wallpaper.","Aug 16, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/paranorman/details
Octubre,Manohla Dargis,69,90,"With a visual style and a deadpan humor that owes an obvious debt to the Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki (""Drifting Clouds""), they hold their shots long enough for you to scan details, look deep into faces and think on how little (or much) it takes to be happy. Here a painted Jesus hovers on a chipped wall, but it's an unholy family of three that finds heaven on earth.","May  5, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/octubre/details
Zero Days,Stephen Holden,77,90,Zero Days has a similarly balanced outlook along with a critical political viewpoint that avoids hysteria and demagogy.

Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale,Jeannette Catsoulis,71,90,The focus of this bizarre Finnish fairy tale - as black as anything the Brothers Grimm could have dreamed up - is a sinister old codger who chews off ears and whose demon minion kidnaps innocent children.

"2 Autumns, 3 Winters",Stephen Holden,75,90,"The wistful, overarching theme is the passing of time in the lives of young adults, aware of growing older, who seek to ground themselves in relationships and work, but relationships most of all.

White Girl,Stephen Holden,65,90,"We’re all familiar with the term contact high, but not with its antithesis. Because it is so believable, White Girl is a contact bummer that’s hard to shake.","Sep  1, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/white-girl/details

Blue Beard,Manohla Dargis,73,90,"Ms. Breillat narrates the fairy tale three ways: in the period story, through the little girls and, finally, through the overall film.

Project Nim,A.O. Scott,83,90,"There is no doubt that Nim was exploited, and also no doubt that he was loved. Mr. Marsh, by allowing those closest to Nim plenty of room to explain themselves, examines the moral complexity of this story without didacticism.

Down by Law,Vincent Canby,75,90,"The excitement of Down by Law comes not from what it's about. Reduced to its plot, it is very slight. But the plot isn't the point.

Sunset Story,Manohla Dargis,80,90,"One of the strengths of Sunset Story is that it introduces us to a pair of extraordinary women who have kept their dignity and independence in a world that conspires against them having either.

The Manchurian Candidate,Dana Stevens,76,90,"A political thriller that manages to be at once silly and clever, buoyantly satirical and sneakily disturbing, but he (Demme) has recovered some of the lightness and sureness of touch that had faded from his movies after ""The Silence of the Lambs.""",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-manchurian-candidate/details
The Town Is Quiet,Stephen Holden,65,90,You are left with an overall impression of a movie so full of life that it is almost bursting at the seams.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-town-is-quiet/details
Airplane!,Janet Maslin,78,90,"At a time when throwaway gags seem like a luxury in any film, Airplane! has jokes—hilarious jokes—to spare. It's also clever and confident and furiously energetic, and it has the two most sadly neglected selling points any movie could want right now: it's brief (only eighty-eight minutes), and it looks inexpensive (it cost about three million dollars) without looking cheap. Airplane! is more than a pleasant surprise, in the midst of this dim movie season. As a remedy for the bloated self-importance of too many other current efforts, it's just what the doctor ordered.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/airplane!/details
Mother of George,A.O. Scott,77,90,"This is not a fable of assimilation or alienation, but rather the keenly observed story of two people seeking guidance in painful and complicated circumstances.","Sep 12, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mother-of-george/details
The Straight Story,Janet Maslin,86,90,"Switching gears radically, bravely defying conventional wisdom about what it takes to excite moviegoers, Lynch presents the flip side of ""Blue Velvet"" and turns it into a supremely improbable triumph.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-straight-story/details
Melancholia,A.O. Scott,80,90,"Melancholia is emphatically not what anyone would call a feel-good movie, and yet it nonetheless leaves behind a glow of aesthetic satisfaction.","Nov 10, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/melancholia/details
Paradise: Hope,Stephen Holden,78,90,"Instead of being contemptuous and sardonic, the portrait of inchoate adolescent longing in Paradise: Hope is poignant.","Dec 17, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/paradise-hope/details
"Moscow, Belgium",Stephen Holden,68,90,The movie's steady attention to detail lends it a texture rarely found in films about domestic life. Its eye and ear for the particular and for what is left unsaid in tense conversation is unerring.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/moscow-belgium/details
Darwin's Nightmare,Dana Stevens,84,90,"Mr. Sauper has produced an extraordinary work of visual journalism, a richly illustrated report on a distant catastrophe that is also one of the central stories of our time.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/darwins-nightmare/details
Down and Out in Beverly Hills,Janet Maslin,82,90,"As a comedy of manners it has a dependably keen aim, with its most wicked barbs leavened by Mr. Mazursky's obvious fondness for his characters.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/down-and-out-in-beverly-hills/details
Osama,Dana Stevens,83,90,"Osama's unvarnished vulnerability, along with the director's combination of tough-mindedness and lyricism, prevents the movie from becoming at all sentimental; instead, it is beautiful, thoughtful and almost unbearably sad.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/osama/details
I.Q.,Janet Maslin,66,90,"The nice thing about I.Q. is that its intelligence doesn't stop at the title. In a romantic comedy that mingles brilliant physicists with auto mechanics, everybody manages to seem smart.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/iq/details
Heaven,Stephen Holden,68,90,"Here the clinical, stopwatch precision of Mr. Tykwer's explorations of synchronicity and Kieslowski's warmer, metaphysically dreamy speculations about the role of chance and coincidence in human affairs synchronize into a film whose formal elegance is matched by its depth of feeling.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/heaven/details
Ten Canoes,Stephen Holden,82,90,"There is nothing more enthralling than a good yarn, and Ten Canoes interweaves two versions of the same story, one filmed in black and white and set a thousand years ago, and an even older one, filmed in color and set in a mythic, prehistoric past.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ten-canoes/details
The Blair Witch Project,Elvis Mitchell,81,90,"A nifty example of how to make something out of nothing.

Sing Your Song,Manohla Dargis,73,90,"The revelations keep coming in Sing Your Song and it's hard not to go googly eyed when, for a 1963 CBS special, you see Mr. Belafonte discussing the march on Washington with some fellow marchers, Mr. Poitier, Marlon Brando, James Baldwin, Charlton Heston and the film director Joseph L.

Bully ,A.O.

Il Futuro,Jeannette Catsoulis,80,90,"Ms. Scherson’s style — backed wholeheartedly by the cool cinematography of Ricardo de Angelis — may value mood over information, but it’s the perfect vehicle for a portrait of two damaged souls grasping for a security they no longer possess.","Sep  5, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-future-2013/details
Mother of Tears,Nathan Lee,52,90,"The Mother of Tears is silly, awkward, vulgar, outlandish, hysterical, inventive, revolting, flamboyant, titillating, ridiculous, mischievous, uproarious, cheap, priceless, tasteless and sublime.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mother-of-tears/details

Gore Vidal: The United States of Amnesia,Stephen Holden,72,90,"Heavily seasoned with epigrams worthy of Oscar Wilde, this entertaining documentary portrays Vidal as a pessimistic political prophet with streaks of paranoia and misanthropy, but a truth teller nonetheless.","May 22, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gore-vidal-the-united-states-of-amnesia/details

Under the Skin,Stephen Holden,78,90,"The movie’s eerie, climactic image challenges our conventional notions of human identity and leaves us reflecting on the possibility that every being in the universe is an alien in disguise.","Apr  3, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/under-the-skin/details
Midnight in Paris,A.O. Scott,81,90,"It is marvelously romantic, even though - or precisely because - it acknowledges the disappointment that shadows every genuine expression of romanticism.","May 19, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/midnight-in-paris/details
Polisse,A.O. Scott,74,90,"The messiness of the film seems appropriate to its subject, which is the attempt to bring at least a measure of order - and even a touch of grace - to a chaotic and frequently ugly reality.","May 17, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/polisse/details
The Trip,Manohla Dargis,82,90,"As in many road movies, the trip becomes an occasion for philosophizing, a journey inward and out as the men joust and parry, improvising and entertaining each other, at times by imitating, hilariously, someone else (Michael Caine, Sean Connery).","Jun  9, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-trip-2011/details
Volver,A.O. Scott,84,90,"Volver, full of surprises and reversals, unfolds with breathtaking ease and self-confidence.

Let It Rain,Stephen Holden,72,90,"Needlessly complicated, life already has more than enough petty dramas.

Microbe and Gasoline,Stephen Holden,75,90,"Time and again, Microbe and Gasoline risks cuteness without going overboard.

The Wind Will Carry Us,Dana Stevens,86,90,Its effects seem more like those of a poem or a piece of music than a movie. Requires the reverent darkness and communal solitude of a theater.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-wind-will-carry-us/details

The Triplets of Belleville,Dana Stevens,91,90,"May be the oddest movie of the year, by turns sweet and sinister, insouciant and grotesque, invitingly funny and forbiddingly dark. It may also be one of the best, a tour de force of ink-washed, crosshatched mischief and unlikely sublimity.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-triplets-of-belleville/details
Kids for Cash,Jeannette Catsoulis,75,90,"Carefully assembled and soberly presented, Robert May’s Kids for Cash takes a lacerating look at America’s juvenile justice system.","Feb 27, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kids-for-cash/details
Snowpiercer,A.O. Scott,84,90,"Though the movie is playfully postmodern in its pastiche of styles and its mingling of sincerity and self-consciousness, there is also something solidly old-fashioned about the way it tells its story.","Jun 26, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/snowpiercer/details

Rust and Bone,A.O. Scott,73,90,"Rust and Bone is a strong, emotionally replete experience, and also a tour de force of directorial button pushing.

Life During Wartime,A.O. Scott,69,90,"It is all perfectly dreadful and at times appallingly funny.

Jackass Number Two,Nathan Lee,66,90,"Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jackass-number-two/details

Back to the Future,Janet Maslin,86,90,"Mr. Zemeckis is able both to keep the story moving and to keep it from going too far.

Urban Cowboy,Vincent Canby,61,90,"Urban Cowboy is the most entertaining, most perceptive commercial American movie of the year to date.

Terms and Conditions May Apply,Jeannette Catsoulis,68,90,"The title of Terms and Conditions May Apply is unlikely to excite, but the content of this quietly blistering documentary should rile even the most passive viewer.","Jul 11, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/terms-and-conditions-may-apply/details

The Cove,Jeannette Catsoulis,84,90,"Like the director's cover story, the movie is a Trojan horse: an exceptionally well-made documentary that unfolds like a spy thriller, complete with bugged hotel rooms, clandestine derring-do and mysterious men in gray flannel suits.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-cove/details
Annie Hall,Vincent Canby,92,90,"There will be discussion about what points in the film coincide with the lives of its two stars, but this, I think, is to detract from and trivialize the achievement of the film, which, at last, puts Woody in the league with the best directors we have.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/annie-hall-1977/details

Letters from the Big Man,Manohla Dargis,66,90,"The woman in Christopher Munch's lovely, delightfully idiosyncratic Letters From the Big Man, resplendent with its own dense forests and cloudy Oregon days, has already fallen to earth and is looking for a way back up or maybe just forward.

Soul Kitchen,Stephen Holden,76,90,"Its insistent zaniness makes Soul Kitchen very different in spirit from Mr. Akin's two previous films, ""Head-On"" and ""The Edge of Heaven,"" which established him as a major European filmmaker.

The Golden Dream,Stephen Holden,74,90,"Buoyed by the wonderfully natural performances of its young leads, La Jaula de Oro is a compelling social-realist drama that owes much to the style of the British social-realist filmmaker Ken Loach.","Sep  3, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-golden-dream/details
Of Time and the City,A.O.

Bill Cunningham New York,,76,90,"If the film suggests that there's something bittersweet about a life dedicated to a single pursuit cultivated with an almost religious fervor, it also stands in awe of its subject's seemingly inexhaustible, self-abnegating capacity to remain attuned to the expression of others.","Mar 17, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bill-cunningham-new-york/details

Botso,Anita Gates,71,90,"With enough tragic-restorative plot twists for a 12-hour mini-series, Botso is an enchanting film for two reasons: Mr. Korisheli’s humanity is magnetic, and no more beautiful case could be made for the psychological healing power of making music.","Oct  9, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/botso/details
Holy Motors,Manohla Dargis,84,90,"It's a gift for moviegoers to have this much freedom, and exhilarating. In Holy Motors you never know where Mr. Carax will take you and you never know what, exactly, you're to do once you're there.","Oct 16, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/holy-motors/details
A Brighter Summer Day (1991),A.O. Scott,90,90,"It is a crowded, complex crime story that is also a tale of sexual awakening and an understated exercise in kitchen-sink realism.

Tulpan,A.O. Scott,88,90,"Might be described as an epic landscape film, a sweetly comic coming-of-age story or a lyrical work of social realism.

Dave Chappelle's Block Party,Manohla Dargis,84,90,"Mr. Chappelle looks and sounds alternately ebullient and weary.

Apocalypse Now Redux,A.O. Scott,92,90,"In spite of its limited perspective on Vietnam, its churning, term-paperish exploration of Conrad and the near incoherence of its ending, (it) is a great movie. It grows richer and stranger with each viewing, and the restoration of scenes left in the cutting room two decades ago has only added to its sublimity.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/apocalypse-now-redux/details
Brotherhood,Stephen Holden,68,90,"If you compared the two main characters with the cowboys in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" they would be ignoble versions of Ennis del Mar (Jimmy) and Jack Twist (Lars).

The Birds,Bosley Crowther,87,90,"Making a terrifying menace out of what is assumed to be one of nature's most innocent creatures and one of man's most melodious friends, Mr. Hitchcock and his associates have constructed a horror film that should raise the hackles on the most courageous and put goose-pimples on the toughest hide.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-birds/details

The Unknown Known,A.O. Scott,69,90,"The film is a cat-and-mouse game in which each player thinks he’s the cat, making it both thrilling and disconcerting to watch.

Everybody Wants Some!!,A.O. Scott,83,90,"Everybody Wants Some!! is more than just nostalgic. It’s downright utopian, a hormonal pastoral endowed with the innocent charm of a children’s book.

This Must Be the Place,A.O. Scott,61,90,"Maybe, beneath the stylistic flourishes and bursts of operatic emotion, it is a simple story of psychological struggle, about a man in midlife reckoning with the damage of his past.

The Great Train Robbery,Vincent Canby,68,90,"Mr. Crichton's previous films as a director — ""Westworld"" and ""Coma"" — are skillful and, each in its own way, entertaining, but they give no hint of the amplitude he displays in this visually dazzling period piece. With Sean Connery as the gang's elegant leader, the sort of mastermind who denies his body nothing, Lesley-Anne Down as his magnificent moll, and Donald Sutherland as his locksmith —""the best screwsman in England"" — The Great Train Robbery is classy entertainment of the sort I associate exclusively with movies.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-great-train-robbery/details
Indignation,Stephen Holden,78,90,"Indignation might be dismissed as a small, exquisite period piece, but it is so precisely rendered that it gets deeply under your skin.","Jul 28, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/indignation/details
Baran,Dana Stevens,79,90,"The lovely clarity of this story, which seems to have been drawn from the literature of an earlier age, is well served by the artful subtlety of the telling. Mr. Majidi prefers imagery to exposition, and his shots are as dense with meaning, and as readily accessible, as Dutch paintings.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/baran/details
Dead Ringers,Elvis Mitchell,86,90,"What makes the performance(s) even better is that Mr. Irons invests these bizarre, potentially freakish characters with so much intelligence and so much real feeling. [23 Sept 1988, p.C10]",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dead-ringers/details

Janis: Little Girl Blue,Stephen Holden,74,90,"Although Ms. Berg’s enthralling film tells a story somewhat similar to “Amy,” Asif Kapadia’s recent documentary portrait of Amy Winehouse (who also died at 27), the demons that devoured Winehouse came from outside as much from within.

Nana,Jeannette Catsoulis,76,90,"Naturalistic and mysterious, Nana is terrifyingly dependent on its diminutive star.

Body Double,Vincent Canby,69,90,"It's sexy and explicitly crude, entertaining and sometimes very funny. It's his most blatant variation to date on a Hitchcock film (""Vertigo""), but it's also a De Palma original, a movie that might have offended Hitchcock's wryly avuncular public personality, while appealing to his darker, most private fantasies.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/body-double/details

Equity,A.O. Scott,68,90,"Equity pulls off a difficult balancing act with an elegance that should not be underestimated.

La Última Película,Andy Webster,62,90,"The movie revels in multiple film stocks (with hairs or threads often on the camera lens) and self-conscious “Last Movie” flourishes (long intervals between credits, “scene missing” title cards, a version of “Me and Bobby McGee”) while maintaining its blithe humor.","Jan  8, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-ultima-pelicula/details

Daylight,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,90,"Not one for climactic endings or predictable histrionics, the director, David Barker (who wrote the script with Ms. Meierhans and Mr. Godere), sticks to the stylistic template of his debut feature, ""Afraid of Everything,"" which was filmed in 1999.

Chris & Don. A Love Story,Stephen Holden,81,90,"The elegantly structured documentary weaves extensive footage of Mr. Bachardy rummaging through their house and reminiscing with readings from Isherwood's diaries by Michael York, old interviews with Isherwood, home movies of their travels and glamorous social life, and commentary by friends, including Leslie Caron and the British filmmaker John Boorman.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/chris-don-a-love-story/details

Gangs of New York,A.O. Scott,72,90,"This is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology, either liberal or conservative. Gangs of New York is nearly a great movie.

Blind Shaft,A.O. Scott,78,90,"Deftly swings to a spartan, engrossing climax, and the final twists spell out what the murderers are made of and the setting responsible for creating them. It is a true piece of film magic.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blind-shaft/details

Starman,Janet Maslin,71,90,"Starman provides him with a role that, played by anyone else, might seem preposterous.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,Manohla Dargis,65,90,"What makes the material still feel personal — other than the yearslong investment and love that transform entertainments into fan communities — is the combination of Katniss and Ms. Lawrence, who have become a perfect fit.","Nov 19, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-2/details
I'm Not There.,A.O. Scott,73,90,"Among its many achievements, Todd Haynes’s I’m Not There hurls a Molotov cocktail through the facade of the Hollywood biopic factory.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/im-not-there/details
Falling Down,Vincent Canby,56,90,"Falling Down is the most interesting, all-out commercial American film of the year to date, and one that will function much like a Rorschach test to expose the secrets of those who watch it.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/falling-down/details

Star Trek,Manohla Dargis,82,90,"Isn't just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series.

Still Mine,Stephen Holden,72,90,"The film’s vision of a long-married couple keeping each other going with mutual love and support, and a shared resistance to outside interference, is more vital than a thousand movies populated by hot, squirming teenagers.","Jul 18, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/still-mine/details

Dirty Pretty Things,A.O. Scott,78,90,"This film has a conquering spirit. The dankness is replaced by an optimistic blast of sunlight at the end, a contrast to the earlier lighting dimmed with human misery. Mr. Frears blasts away the blight, though he doesn't have to work to restore Okwe's dignity. It shines through from the start.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-pretty-things/details

The Fighter,A.O. Scott,79,90,"With solid bodywork, clever feints and tremendous heart, it scores at least a TKO, by which I mean both that it falls just short of overpowering greatness - I can't quite exclaim, ""It's a knockout!"" - and that the most impressive thing about it is technique.","Dec  9, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-fighter/details

Stranger Things,Jeannette Catsoulis,85,90,"Something unexpectedly profound emerges from the flimsiest of stories in Stranger Things, a drama so modest and trusting of its two leads that any directing flourishes might have shattered its spell.","Apr  4, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/stranger-things/details

Theater of War,Manohla Dargis,68,90,"Because this is also a document of an actress actually at work, much of the movie's pleasure comes from watching another brilliant performance take shape as Ms. Streep tries out different line readings, gestures and poses in her search for Mother Courage.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/theater-of-war/details

The Messenger,A.O.

I'm Glad My Mother Is Alive,Stephen Holden,73,90,"I'm Glad My Mother Is Alive is anything but the clichéd fantasy of a blissful mother-child reunion.

The Order of Myths,Manohla Dargis,79,90,"Eschewing voice-over or any obvious trace of an on-screen or off-screen presence, she (Brown) lets her images, a little text and other people do the talking for her. Her quiet has its own force.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-order-of-myths/details

Side Effects,A.O. Scott,75,90,"While the plot may be predictable (and more than a little preposterous) in retrospect, Mr. Soderbergh handles it brilliantly, serving notice once again that he is a crackerjack genre technician.","Feb  7, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-bitter-pill/details

Princess,Jeannette Catsoulis,85,90,"Thanks to Ms. Haas’s truly remarkable lead performance (she was 16 at the time of filming) and Ms. Shalom-Ezer’s nuanced dialogue, Adar’s journey finally feels more like one of empowerment than victimization.","May 26, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/princess/details
Love! Valour! Compassion!,Stephen Holden,59,90,One reason the film version of Terrence McNally's play Love! Valour! Compassion! is so moving is that this complicated group portrait never loses its slippery emotional footing.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/love!-valour!-compassion!/details

Northfork,Dana Stevens,64,90,"There is nothing quite like this movie, and I'm not altogether sure there is much more to it than its lovely peculiarity.

The Kid Stays in the Picture,A.O. Scott,75,90,"One of the funniest, and most telling, films of the year.

Fair Game,A.O. Scott,69,90,"Things worked out between Joe and Valerie, and for their real-life models, who are now the subjects of a terrifically entertaining movie.

OT: Our Town,Dana Stevens,75,90,"At the end, when they have created a vibrant new theater program for their school, their sense of triumph is infectious.

It Follows,Stephen Holden,83,90,"It Follows recycles familiar teenage horror tropes — a girl alone in a house, evil forces banging on a door — but its mood is dreamy.

The Last of the Unjust,A.O.

Howl's Moving Castle,Dana Stevens,80,90,"Sophie, in both her incarnations, joins an impressive sisterhood of Miyazaki heroines, whose version of girl power presents a potent alternative to the mini-machismo that dominates American juvenile entertainment.

Marwencol,Jeannette Catsoulis,83,90,"Four years in the making, Marwencol emerges as a number of things: an absorbing portrait of an outsider artist; a fascinating journey from near-death to active life; a meditation on the brain's ability to forge new pathways when old ones have been destroyed.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/marwencol/details
Simon Killer,Jeannette Catsoulis,63,90,"Though the film’s ice-cold blend of the cerebral and the atavistic can be off-putting, it enables a queasy portrait of moral disengagement that lingers long after Simon has slipped from the screen.","Apr  4, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/simon-killer/details
Mistaken for Strangers,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,90,"A tale of two brothers, one band and a boatload of psychological baggage, Mistaken for Strangers is, like its maker, scruffy, undisciplined and eager to be loved.

Little Otik,A.O. Scott,74,90,"A handmade dream, cobbled together from dirt, wood and more imagination than most of us can muster in our most fevered states.

Black Butterflies,Stephen Holden,66,90,"In its jagged style and tone Black Butterflies is as close to an inside-out view of Jonker's tumultuous life as a movie could go without sinking into chaos.

Grease,Vincent Canby,70,90,"GREASE is not really the 1950's teen-age movie musical it thinks it is, but a contemporary fantasy about a 1950's teen-age musical—a larger, funnier, wittier and more imaginative-than-Hollywood movie with a life that is all its own. It uses the Eisenhower era — the characters, costumes, gestures and particularly, the music—to create a time and place that have less to do with any real 50's than with a kind of show business that is both timeless and old-fashioned, both sentimental and wise. The movie is also terrific fun.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/grease/details
Bronson,A.O. Scott,71,90,"Bronson invites you to admire its protagonist as a pure, muscular embodiment of anarchy. And perhaps you will, but you may also be glad that he’s still behind bars.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bronson/details
Even the Rain (Tambien la Lluvia),Stephen Holden,69,90,"Splendidly panoramic. The scenes of Columbus's arrival and of his imperialist and religious sloganeering, and of the carnage he wreaks, have a grandeur and a force reminiscent of Terrence Malick films. The segments about the chaotic water riots have a documentary immediacy.","Feb 17, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/even-the-rain-tambien-la-lluvia/details
Fever,Dana Stevens,62,90,"Every shot seems measured for maximum effect, and when the pace suddenly quickens in a late action sequence on a deserted subway train, it results in a moment of pure Hitchcockian panic that reverberates like thunder in the fretful, melancholy air.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fever/details
Queen of Katwe,A.O. Scott,73,90,"In Ms. Nair’s hands, Phiona’s story has a richness and unpredictability that separates it from other, superficially similar movies.

Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles,Andy Webster,60,90,"Though their quarry eventually appears to be a model of paranoia and prejudice, it's the thrill of the hunt that keeps Resurrect Dead compelling.","Sep  1, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/resurrect-dead-the-mystery-of-the-toynbee-tiles/details

Bombay Beach,Stephen Holden,74,90,"Looks and feels like a fever dream about an alternate universe. Suffused with a sense of wonder, it hovers, dancing inside its own ethereal bubble.","Feb 13, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bombay-beach/details
Wild Grass,Stephen Holden,65,90,"Like its would-be lovers, Wild Grass chases itself in circles as it scrambles genres, examining seeing, thinking, remembering and imagining with a zany awareness.

Boyz n the Hood,Elvis Mitchell,76,90,"The film's strength is that it sustains an intimate and realistic tone.

Family Affair,Jeannette Catsoulis,65,90,"The filmmaking is rough and rather clumsy, but by ceding the floor to his open, highly articulate sisters, Mr. Colvard has created a fascinatingly raw study of ferociously wielded male power.","Nov 18, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/family-affair/details

Young Frankenstein,Vincent Canby,80,90,"As played by Gene Wilder in Mel Brooks's funniest, most cohesive comedy to date, this Dr. Frankenstein is a marvelous addled mixture of young Tom Edison, Winnie-the-Pooh, and your average Playboy reader with a keen appreciation of beautiful bosoms.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/young-frankenstein/details

Putty Hill,Stephen Holden,78,90,"Putty Hill doesn't strive for overt social commentary.

Heart of a Dog,Manohla Dargis,84,90,"Heart of a Dog is about telling and remembering and forgetting, and how we put together the fragments that make up our lives — their flotsam and jetsam, highs and lows, meaningful and slight details, shrieking and weeping headline news.","Oct 20, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/heart-of-a-dog/details
Tell Them Who You Are,Stephen Holden,72,90,"Near the beginning of the movie, the younger Wexler admits that the film is his attempt to get closer to his father.

Next Day Air,Nathan Lee,46,90,"With a script that snaps, characters that pop, a blaze of streetwise attitude and enough firepower to pulverize a significant chunk of South Philadelphia, Next Day Air nears neo-blaxploitation perfection. Good things come in strange packages.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/nextdayair/details
Network,Vincent Canby,88,90,"Network can be faulted both for going too far and not far enough, but it's also something that very few commercial films are these days. It's alive. This, I suspect, is the Lumet drive. It's also the wit of performers like Mr. Finch, Mr. Holden, and Miss Dunaway.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/network/details
Slap Shot,Vincent Canby,61,90,"The performances—which have a lot to do with the right casting, particularly in the smaller roles—are impeccable. Paul Newman maintains an easy balance between star and character-actor. The leading-man authority is there, but it's given comic perspective by the intensity of the character and by its tackiness, evident even in the clothes he wears.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/slap-shot/details
Hitchcock/Truffaut,Jeannette Catsoulis,79,90,"Curating a selection of the original interview recordings (whose sound quality is damn near pristine), Mr. Jones fashions an unfaltering encomium that’s entirely free of the highfalutin monologues that might deter noncinephiles.","Dec  2, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hitchcocktruffaut/details
Little Hope Was Arson,Neil Genzlinger,78,90,"The filmmaker, Theo Love, presents the people in the story as they are, without passing judgment and without apology, whether they are investigators or pastors or just ordinary folks caught up in the inexplicable.

The Informant!,Manohla Dargis,66,90,"It is Mr. Soderbergh’s insistence on seeing the A.D.M. scandal as a collective tragedy rather than as another white-collar crime that gives the movie force, resonance, feeling.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-informant!/details
Festival Express,Dave Kehr,85,90,"To watch the biggest stars of their time in casual conversation, trading riffs and passing bottles, without benefit of publicists, handlers and security goons is to relive an innocent, anarchic time in the entertainment business when music, not marketing, was at the center of the enterprise.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/festival-express/details
A Screaming Man,Manohla Dargis,72,90,"It's a modest film, if only in scale and apparent budget, about some of the greatest questions in life, like the existence of God, our capacity to see beyond our own vanity and the legacies of fathers, both blood and state.","Apr 14, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-screaming-man/details

The Player,Vincent Canby,86,90,"So entertaining, so flip and so genially irreverent that it seems to announce the return of the great gregarious film maker whose ""Nashville"" remains one of the classics of the 1970's.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-player/details
The Last Mistress,Manohla Dargis,78,90,"What’s explicit here is ravenous passion and the depiction of desire as a creating, destroying force that invades the very flesh. It's terribly French.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-last-mistress/details
Valley of Tears,Dave Kehr,68,90,"Dense, contradictory and distressingly honest, Valley of Tears is that rarity among political documentaries: a genuinely thought-provoking film.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/valley-of-tears/details
Gomorrah,Manohla Dargis,87,90,"Part of what's bracing about Gomorrah, and makes it feel different from so many American crime movies, is both its deadly serious take on violence and its global understanding of how far and wide the mob's tentacles reach, from high fashion to the very dirt.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gomorrah/details
The Company Men,Stephen Holden,69,90,"The movie is realistic enough to make all corporate climbers, but especially men over 50, quake in their boots. If you are what you do, what are you if you're no longer doing it?","Dec  9, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-company-men/details

Wild,A.O.

The Man Without a Past,Dana Stevens,84,90,"Like the great films of the 1930's and early 40's, it is at once artful and unpretentious, sophisticated and completely accessible, sure of its own authority and generous toward characters and audience alike -- a movie whose intended public is the human race.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-man-without-a-past/details
Splice,Manohla Dargis,66,90,"Mr. Natali, whose earlier films include “Cube,” hasn’t reinvented the horror genre.

Moonrise Kingdom,Manohla Dargis,84,90,"Moonrise Kingdom breezes along with a beautifully coordinated admixture of droll humor, deadpan and slapstick.

Murder on the Orient Express,Vincent Canby,63,90,"Like the lovely, extravagantly overemphasized nineteen-thirties' costumes and production designed by Tony Walton, Murder on the Orient Express is much less a literal re-creation of a type of thirties movie than an elaborate and witty tribute that never for a moment condescends to the subject.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/murder-on-the-orient-express-1974/details
The Breadwinner,Glenn Kenny,80,90,"In its alternating of Parvana’s day-to-day struggle with the tale she tells herself, the movie doesn’t promote bromides about stories and storytelling transcending reality.

Battle Royale,A.O. Scott,81,90,"American fans of ""The Hunger Games"" may not embrace - or even be permitted to see - Battle Royale, which is too bad.

Dressed to Kill,Vincent Canby,74,90,"A witty, romantic, psychological horror film and it's almost as rewarding as a successful analysis...The fun is not in logic but watching how Mr. De Palma successfully tops himself as he goes along, and the fun lasts from the sexy, comic opening sequence right through to the film's several endings.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dressed-to-kill/details

Eastern Promises,A.O.

Boy,David DeWitt,70,90,"This unpretentious comic tale of a youngster's growing relationship with a long-absent father has a surprising rhythmic genius: joy juxtaposed with humiliation, silliness with sadness, fantasy with reality, and none of it formulaic. The editing feels fresh, as does the film.","Mar  1, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/boy/details
Mistress America,Stephen Holden,75,90,"Far from romanticizing creativity and the artistic process, Mr. Baumbach’s films portray the world of painters, filmmakers and literati as an overcrowded, amoral jungle of viperish entitled narcissists stealing from one another for fame and profit.","Aug 13, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mistress-america/details
Half Nelson,Manohla Dargis,85,90,"What makes Half Nelson both an unusual and an exceptional American film, particularly at a time when even films about Sept. 11 are professed to have no politics, is its insistence on political consciousness as a moral imperative.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/half-nelson/details

Wendy and Lucy,A.O. Scott,80,90,"What will happen to her? The strength of this short, simple, perfect story of a young woman and her dog is that this does not seem, by the end, to be an idle or trivial question.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,Manohla Dargis,81,90,"Mr. Abrams may be as worshipful as any Star Wars obsessive, but in The Force Awakens he’s made a movie that goes for old-fashioned escapism even as it presents a futuristic vision of a pluralistic world that his audience already lives in.

A Clockwork Orange,Vincent Canby,78,90,"It seems to me that by describing horror with such elegance and beauty, Kubrick has created a very disorienting but human comedy, not warm and lovable, but a terrible sum- up of where the world is at... Because it refuses to use the emotions conventionally, demanding instead that we keep a constant, intellectual grip on things, it's a most unusual--and disorienting--movie experience.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-clockwork-orange/details
Tyson,A.O. Scott,83,90,"Mr. Toback's film, partly because it restricts itself to Mr. Tyson's point of view, offers a rare and vivid study in the complexity of a single suffering, raging soul.

For Colored Girls,Manohla Dargis,50,90,"As it turns out, Mr. Perry, while busily establishing his economic independence, has been finding his voice as a filmmaker.

Blackfish,Jeannette Catsoulis,83,90,"Unapologetically designed both to inform and affect, Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s delicately lacerating documentary, Blackfish, uses the tragic tale of a single whale and his human victims as the backbone of a hypercritical investigation into the marine-park giant SeaWorld Entertainment.","Jul 18, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blackfish/details

Escapes,Manohla Dargis,72,90,Mr. Fancher’s movie love and way of spinning a yarn to its near-breaking point — one detour opens onto another — dovetail nicely with the cinephilia and playfulness that characterize Mr. Almereyda’s movies.,"Jul 26, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/escapes/details

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,A.O. Scott,88,90,"Never has a film so strongly been a product of a director's respect for its source.

A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas,Neil Genzlinger,61,90,"N.P.H, as he's often called in these films, does indeed return, singing and dancing. And talking dirty.

Dheepan,A.O. Scott,76,90,"[Mr. Audiard] makes popcorn movies disguised as art films, and vice versa. Dheepan is a bit like a Liam Neeson revenge-dad action thriller directed by the Dardenne brothers.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,Dana Stevens,68,90,"This is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy, and also the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed.

Don't Blink - Robert Frank,A.O. Scott,75,90,"You leave with a vivid sense of the man’s living presence and a reasonably thorough account of his life, work and associations.

The Four Times (Le Quattro Volte),A.O. Scott,80,90,"There is something startling, even shocking, about the angle of vision Mr. Frammartino imposes by juxtaposing apparently disparate elements and lingering on what seem at first to be insignificant details.

Farmageddon,Jeannette Catsoulis,62,90,"Nonetheless, the film's homespun quality (Ms. Canty, whose childlike voice provides intermittent narration, simply describes herself in the publicity notes as ""the mom of four kids"") works in its favor, as does its maker's agitated sincerity.","Jul  8, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/farmageddon/details

Burn,Stephen Holden,82,90,"For all the alarming statistics cited in the film, Burn is not a depressing movie.

Guidance,Jeannette Catsoulis,66,90,Mr. Mills (drawing on his own experiences and doing triple duty as the director and screenwriter) gives a performance of rancid single-mindedness.

Behemoth,Ben Kenigsberg,85,90,"Behemoth proceeds placidly, making it easy to become lulled. Its haunting power grows in retrospect — as if you’ve returned from a journey and can’t believe what you’ve seen.","Jan 26, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/behemoth/details
Flags of Our Fathers,Manohla Dargis,79,90,"If Flags of Our Fathers feels so unlike most war movies and sounds so contrary to the usual political rhetoric, it is not because it affirms that war is hell, which it does with unblinking, graphic brutality. It’s because Mr. Eastwood insists, with a moral certitude that is all too rare in our movies, that we extract an unspeakable cost when we ask men to kill other men. There is never any doubt in the film that the country needed to fight this war, that it was necessary; it is the horror at such necessity that defines Flags of Our Fathers, not exultation.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/flags-of-our-fathers/details
Revenge of the Mekons,Ben Kenigsberg,77,90,"The film is both a generous primer on the band, which grew out of the punk movement in Leeds, England, in 1977, and a celebration of its longevity.","Oct 28, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/revenge-of-the-mekons/details

The Queen of Versailles,A.O. Scott,80,90,"Schadenfreude and disgust may be unavoidable, but to withhold all sympathy from the Siegels is to deny their humanity and shortchange your own.

Fantastic Mr. Fox,A.O. Scott,83,90,"In some ways his (Anderson) most fully realized and satisfying film.

Oscar and Lucinda,Elvis Mitchell,66,90,"As directed exquisitely by Gillian Armstrong in a headstrong spirit that recalls her debut feature, ""My Brilliant Career,"" this elliptical tale makes up in visual beauty whatever it lacks in universal meaning.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/oscar-and-lucinda/details
Take This Waltz,A.O. Scott,68,90,"Take This Waltz, Sarah Polley's honest, sure-footed, emotionally generous second feature.

Twelve Monkeys,Elvis Mitchell,74,90,"Fierce and disturbing, with a plot that skillfully resists following any familiar course.

Foreign Parts,A.O. Scott,78,90,"People talk but don't say too much, and as curious and thorough as Ms. Paravel and Mr. Sniadecki are - Foreign Parts is the result of many months of patient filming - they are too polite to pry.

Jackie,Manohla Dargis,81,90,"The film has the requisite surface fidelity....

The Adjustment Bureau,Manohla Dargis,60,90,"One reason filmmakers like Mr. Nolfi seem attracted to Philip K.

Our School,Jeannette Catsoulis,79,90,"Discrimination against nomadic populations is hardly restricted to Romania, but the integration of that country's largest ethnic minority seems particularly pressing.

Spider-Man 2,Dana Stevens,83,90,"Better than its predecessor, and also superior to most other comic-book-based movies.

War Photographer,Dana Stevens,79,90,"Documenting war is a small, partial but indispensable step toward its eventual eradication.

Scheherazade Tell Me a Story,Jeannette Catsoulis,75,90,"Lively, swift, vibrantly colorful and for the most part wonderfully acted, the film is slyly aware of the daytime talk show as a vehicle for women's concerns.","Aug 11, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/scheherazade-tell-me-a-story/details
The Big Picture,Stephen Holden,71,90,"Paul is not a sociopath like Tom Ripley, and the movie does not convey the same diabolical Hitchcockian sense of being manipulated by a slightly sadistic master puppeteer.

Love,Jeannette Catsoulis,79,90,"Love is a mournful thriller about the myth of assimilation and the way nurture - or, more precisely, the lack of it - fashions identity and character.

Damn!,Neil Genzlinger,44,90,"Mr. Fisher-Cohen captures Mr. McMillan's transformation from a guy with a funny look and line into someone who believes his own hype and misconstrues his Warholian 15 minutes for widespread popularity and influence.

Patience (After Sebald),A.O.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind,Vincent Canby,90,90,"Steven Spielberg's giant, spectacular Close Encounters of the Third Kind...is the best—the most elaborate—1950's science fiction movie ever made, a work that borrows its narrative shape and its concerns from those earlier films, but enhances them with what looks like the latest developments in movie and space technology.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind/details

The Dish & the Spoon,Stephen Holden,72,90,"This wisp of a movie doesn't pretend to be more than a series of disconnected vignettes in a moody story that sometimes seems invented on the spot.

The Conformist (re-release),Vincent Canby,100,90,"The movie is perfectly cast, from Trintignant and on down, including Pierre Clementi, who appears briefly as the wicked young man who makes a play for the young Marcello.

Graduation,A.O. Scott,84,90,"Graduation is long and intense, a rigorously naturalistic film that at times feels as claustrophobic and suspenseful as a horror movie.

House of Games,Vincent Canby,78,90,"Though House of Games is not of the dramatic heft of the playwright's ''American Buffalo'' and ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' the screenplay is the first true Mamet work to reach the screen, and the direction illuminates it at every turn.

Palo Alto,Manohla Dargis,69,90,"What tethers the movie and especially April and Teddy is how Ms. Coppola captures that exquisitely tender, moving moment between fragile, self-interested youth and tentatively more outwardly aware adulthood, a coming into consciousness that she expresses through their broken sentences, diverted glances and abrupt turns.","May  8, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/palo-alto/details
Kite,Rachel Saltz,67,90,"Patang (""The Kite""), Prashant Bhargava's first feature, has a lovely, unforced quality.

The Edge of Heaven,A.O. Scott,85,90,"By the end you know the characters in it so well that you can't believe you've seen the movie only once, yet on a second viewing it seems completely new.

36 vues du Pic Saint Loup,A.O. Scott,63,90,"At under 90 minutes, Around a Small Mountain is, by Mr. Rivette’s standards, a small vignette.

Buck,Manohla Dargis,76,90,"In some sense it was beauty that saved Mr. Brannaman, that of his conscience and that of horses, which, having been tied to humans long ago, became companions, workers and for some, as this lovely movie shows, saviors.","Jun 16, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/buck/details
Ben-Hur,Bosley Crowther,90,90,The artistic quality and taste of Mr. Wyler have prevailed to make this a rich and glowing drama that far transcends the bounds of spectacle.

Jauja,A.O.

Dinner for Schmucks,A.O. Scott,56,80,"The film collects a cast of performers who know how to be funny.

Ghostbusters II,Vincent Canby,56,80,"Even the special effects are more to the point of the comedy than they were in the first film.

Logan,Manohla Dargis,77,80,"Logan is a strong argument for bringing the comic-book movie down to earth.

Bitch,Jeannette Catsoulis,53,80,"As she did in her gentler but equally original “Good Dick” in 2008, Ms. Palka carves a black and biting niche between a man and a woman, a space where chaos and psychological unease demand to be reckoned with.","Nov  9, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bitch/details

Hot Fuzz,Manohla Dargis,81,80,"Since Mr. Wright and Mr. Pegg are essentially parodying self-parodies, they have also smartly kinked up their conceit by setting most of the film in a sleepy village that might as well be called Ye Old English Towne, thereby wedding one of the most irritating British exports to one of the most absurd American ones.

The Way,Neil Genzlinger,64,80,"The beauty of the movie, in fact, is that Mr. Estevez does not make explicit what any of them find, beyond friendship.

Suffragette,A.O. Scott,67,80,"Suffragette is an admirably modest movie. It does not quite have the grandeur and force of “Selma,” and the script has a few too many glowingly emotive speeches.

The Golden Bowl,Stephen Holden,62,80,"If this handsome, faithful, intelligent screen adaptation of the novel doesn't leave you devastated, its ominous sense of a rarefied moral and aesthetic world bending before the accelerating streetcar of history will leave you with a mournful sense of loss.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-golden-bowl/details
Sophie Scholl: The Final Days,Stephen Holden,76,80,"This gripping true story, directed in a cool, semi-documentary style by the German filmmaker Marc Rothemund from a screenplay by Fred Breinersdorfer, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sophie-scholl-the-final-days/details
Copenhagen,David DeWitt,71,80,"Mark Raso’s first feature, Copenhagen, takes on a taboo — great for high-stakes storytelling, if it’s not used to generate empty shock.

Hot Shots!,Janet Maslin,61,80,"Charlie Sheen brings just the right exaggerated seriousness to his ace pilot's role, and Cary Elwes perfectly captures the ingenue arrogance of Topper's handsome rival.

In Between Days,A.O.

Moka,Glenn Kenny,69,80,"The movie’s climax has sufficient twists and turns for a conventional payoff.

Red Eye,Manohla Dargis,71,80,"The casting of the two leads is a nice surprise in Red Eye, as is its modest scale. One of the ironies about the film is that its relatively small-movie feel allows Mr. Craven to focus on the sorts of things - the performances and little bits of business from the extras - that a director like Michael Bay doesn't have time for, partly because he is so busy blowing stuff up.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/red-eye/details

A Brilliant Young Mind,Stephen Holden,65,80,"This warm, robust movie ultimately transcends the formulas with which it flirts to become a far more subtle and honest result than a machine-tooled tear-jerker like “The Theory of Everything.” When the film doesn’t try to build up the usual suspense found in movies about competition, you sigh with relief.","Sep 10, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-brilliant-young-mind/details

Maggie's Plan,A.O. Scott,76,80,"Ms. Miller’s choices are hard to argue with. She steers gracefully through a zigzagging plot, slowing down for quiet, contemplative stretches and pausing for jokes that are irrelevant but irresistible.

Code Unknown: Incomplete Tales of Several Journeys,Anita Gates,74,80,"Haneke, who wrote and directed, is a skillful, minutely observant filmmaker who trusts his audience to be able to put two and two together.

Ruthless People,Vincent Canby,78,80,"THE most irresistible thing about the characters in Ruthless People, a conspicuously overconsuming, Beverly Hills update of O. Henry's classic Ransom of Red Chief, is that they all try with such earnestness to live up to their ruthless reputations.

New Suit,Dave Kehr,53,80,"What's oddly appealing about this film is the sweetness that the director, Fran&#231;ois Velle, manages to extract from Craig Sherman's rather bitter screenplay.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/new-suit/details
Dirty Dancing,Vincent Canby,65,80,"The dancing itself, especially the dirty dancing, choreographed by Kenny Ortega, looks very contemporary, or, at least, as contemporary as ""Saturday Night Fever,"" but it has a drive and a pulse that give the filim real excitement.

Red Satin,Stephen Holden,73,80,"The movie rides on Ms. Abbass's serenely confident performance.

Jodorowsky's Dune,Jeannette Catsoulis,79,80,"Cheerfully partial and unapologetically deferential to its subject’s operatic self-promotion, Jodorowsky’s Dune makes you wish that he had scraped together the final $5 million needed, we are told, to realize his dream.","Mar 20, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jodorowskys-dune/details

The Witnesses,Stephen Holden,75,80,"The Witnesses may frustrate those who prefer movies that tell clear-cut stories in which hard lessons are learned.

The Future,A.O. Scott,67,80,"The magical, metaphorical strain in The Future is what makes it powerful, unsettling and strange, as well as charming.

Neil Young: Heart of Gold,Manohla Dargis,85,80,"At one point, during one of his occasional verbal rambles, he (Young) says half-jokingly, half-defensively that he's got some love songs left in him.

Curious George,Lawrence Van Gelder,62,80,"With top-drawer voice talent including Joan Plowright and Dick Van Dyke, original songs by Jack Johnson, and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation that echoes the simple colors and shapes of the books, Curious George is an unexpected delight.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/curious-george/details
True Adolescents,Stephen Holden,57,80,"True Adolescents, like most indie movies related to the mumblecore school, is a delicate piece of machinery.

Sunday Ball,Jeannette Catsoulis,80,80,"Captured more for poetry than for clarity, the topography of penalties and free kicks can be impossible to follow.

Captain Fantastic,Manohla Dargis,72,80,"It’s left to Mr. Mortensen, who can make menace feel like vulnerability — and turn vulnerability into a confession — to keep the movie from slipping into sentimentality.

Cooper and Hemingway: The True Gen,Andy Webster,54,80,"In its allegiance to detail, the film is too long and perhaps overstates its case in claiming that later generations have lost an understanding of common courage, as depicted by these two artists.

Daydream Nation,Stephen Holden,57,80,"Daydream Nation hopscotches forward and backward and in and out of the surreal; its abrupt tangents are announced by chapter headings.

Get Shorty,Elvis Mitchell,82,80,"The author's sardonic voice has been lost in most films based on his fiction, but this one nicely captures that unruffled Leonard authority.

Happenstance,Dana Stevens,59,80,"Perhaps it's all a bit too much, and perhaps it doesn't add up, but the loose ends give the picture a jaunty, improvised feeling that, while it leads to some confusion, is ultimately part of its whimsical charm.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/happenstance/details
Babel,A.O. Scott,69,80,"In the end Babel, like that tower in the book of Genesis, is a grand wreck, an incomplete monument to its own limitless ambition.

The Fitzgerald Family Christmas,Stephen Holden,62,80,"Mr. Burns shuffles this dense material with the dexterity of a card shark. The pace, although swift, is never rushed.

Into the Abyss,A.O. Scott,74,80,"Into the Abyss superficially resembles the kind of titillating, moralizing true-crime shockumentary that is a staple of off-hours cable television.

Words and Pictures,Stephen Holden,49,80,"Words and Pictures has a host of flaws, but the performances by Mr. Owen and Ms. Binoche have a crackling vitality, and the screenplay’s strongest moments set off the kind of trains of thought that dedicated teachers hope to spur in their students.","May 22, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/words-and-pictures/details

Some Like It Hot,,97,80,"Let's face it. Two hours is too long a time to harp on one joke. But Billy Wilder, who produced, directed and collaborated with I. A. L. Diamond on this breeziest of scripts, proves once again that he is as professional as anyone in Hollywood. Mr. Wilder, abetted by such equally proficient operatives as Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, surprisingly has developed a completely unbelievable plot into a broad farce in which authentically comic action vies with snappy and sophisticated dialogue.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/some-like-it-hot/details

Tokyo Sonata,Manohla Dargis,80,80,"Tokyo Sonata, looks like a family melodrama -- if a distinctly eccentric variant on the typical domestic affair -- there is more than a touch of horror to its story of a salaryman whose downsizing sets off a series of cataclysmic events.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tokyo-sonata/details
Jaws,Vincent Canby,87,80,"If you think about Jaws for more than 45 seconds you will recognize it as nonsense, but it's the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun, if you like to have the wits scared out of you at irregular intervals.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jaws/details

Time Out of Mind,A.O. Scott,75,80,"Mr. Gere is fascinating to observe in this role, partly because he refuses to solicit sympathy, or even attention.

Collapse,Jeannette Catsoulis,71,80,"His well-rehearsed rhetoric is shockingly persuasive, and since the majority of his premises are verifiable, any weakness in his argument lies in inferences so terrifying that reasonable listeners may find themselves taking his advice and stocking up on organic seeds.

Guncrazy,Vincent Canby,69,80,"Taking Mr. Bright's excellent screenplay, Ms. Davis, whose background is in music videos, has made a remarkably rich melodrama with a strong narrative line and vivid characters.

Kingdom of Shadows,Andy Webster,65,80,"The American demand for drugs, which feeds the cartels, is mentioned, though regrettably not expanded upon.

Fatima,Stephen Holden,69,80,"If the movie, loosely based on two books by Fatima Elayoubi, tells a familiar story of immigrants struggling to make something of themselves in an alien culture (Fatima speaks some French but reads only Arabic), it does so in a tone that is kindhearted but clearheaded, and the performances are low-key and believable.","Aug 25, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fatima/details

The Sting,Vincent Canby,80,80,"A lot of the other period details aren't too firmly anchored in time, but the film is so good-natured, so obviously aware of everything it's up to, even its own picturesque frauds, that I opt to go along with it.

We Are Twisted F***ing Sister!,Glenn Kenny,65,80,The movie tells an incomplete version of the band’s story...but provides a comprehensive and sometimes harrowing portrayal of the grind a working bar band in the 1970s had to endure to get by.,"Feb 18, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/we-are-twisted-fucking-sister!/details

The Wailing,Glenn Kenny,81,80,"I was so invested with Jong-gu and his family that as the suspense, violence and worse ratcheted up, I was not merely scared, but heartbroken. An overly literal bit of business at the end slightly undermines the film. As a whole, though, The Wailing is the hard stuff.

The Fallen Idol (re-release),Manohla Dargis,88,80,"Beautifully shot by the French cinematographer Georges Périnal (whose credits include Cocteau's ""Blood of a Poet""), the film soon evolves from a claustrophobic domestic affair into a mordantly discomfiting look at the betrayal of innocence.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-fallen-idol/details

Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Manohla Dargis,81,80,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople takes a troika of familiar story types — the plucky kid, the crusty geezer, the nurturing bosom — and strips them of cliché. Charming and funny, it is a drama masquerading as a comedy about an unloved boy whom nobody wants until someone says, Yes, I’ll love him.","Jun 23, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople/details

Nanking,Stephen Holden,76,80,What makes the film bearable is the knowledge that a few people did what they could to hold the line against humanity’s worst instincts.

Inspector Bellamy,A.O.

Free Fire,Glenn Kenny,63,80,"Free Fire is an action movie finely tuned to even the most potentially vicious audiences’ tolerances. It is filled with mayhem, but avoids grisly violence — at least until the finale pulls out some gory, and not inapt, punch lines. Luxuriating in disreputability in all the right ways, the film also contains no shortage of profane verbal wit.","Apr 20, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/free-fire/details

Rubble Kings,Daniel M. Gold,62,80,"At slightly more than an hour, the film may not be definitive, and its chronology is a little fuzzy.

Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Impassioned Eye,Stephen Holden,59,80,"The documentary, which subscribes to the Great Man school of reverential portraiture, is not a biography but an interview (in French, simultaneously translated into English) conceived as a master class on art appreciation, with guest commentators augmenting Cartier-Bresson's own sparsely chosen words.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/henri-cartier-bresson-the-impassioned-eye/details

The White Diamond,Dana Stevens,83,80,"The film, which includes some breathtakingly beautiful images of the green, wet Guyanese jungle and a monumental waterfall that cuts through it, is driven less by narrative than by ideas and impressions.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-white-diamond/details

The Taste of Money,A.O. Scott,54,80,"Even as The Taste of Money swerves toward a frantic climax and a sentimental denouement, it remains intriguing. It feeds an insatiable curiosity about how the other half - or, in current parlance, the 1 percent - lives, and what it shows us is gorgeous, grotesque and disconcertingly human.","Jan 24, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-taste-of-money/details
Wolke Neun,Jeannette Catsoulis,64,80,"All the more disappointing, then, when what has been a celebration of last-ditch passion slides abruptly into a cautionary tale. Until that point the movie's refreshingly unbiased tone allows us to make our own moral judgments, teasing us with the possibility that, occasionally, the scarlet woman can escape unbranded. I, for one, was rooting for her.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/wolke-neun/details

The Tracey Fragments,A.O. Scott,54,80,"In the hands of a more literal-minded filmmaker The Tracey Fragments might well have been dreary and unbearable, a chronicle of florid self-pity justified by arbitrary cruelty. Instead it is fierce, enigmatic and affecting.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-tracey-fragments/details
Tokyo Godfathers,Dana Stevens,73,80,"For all its echoes of Frank Capra and Charlie Chaplin (as well as Ford), the movie is also a love letter to modern Tokyo, whose alleyways and skyscrapers are drafted with flawless precision and tinted with tenderness and warmth.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tokyo-godfathers/details
Hollywood Shuffle,Janet Maslin,74,80,"An exuberant satire, uneven but tirelessly energetic, with the kind of comic bluster that can override any lapse.

Pop & Me,Stephen Holden,62,80,"For a film devoted to celebrating intimacy and the breaking down of emotional barriers, Pop and Me is oddly withholding of information about the travelers.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pop-me/details
United in Anger: A History of ACT UP,Jeannette Catsoulis,73,80,"And by exploring the lighter side of communal action - the camaraderie and cruising that turned weekly meetings into what one member calls ""a combination of serious politics and joyful living"" - he uncouples the gravity of the cause from the perceived humorlessness of advocacy.

Mad Dog and Glory,Vincent Canby,71,80,"The great satisfaction of Mad Dog and Glory is watching Mr. De Niro and Mr. Murray play against type with such invigorating ease.

The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,Vincent Canby,69,80,"With their remarkable contributions, ''Baron Munchausen'' is full of moments that dazzle, just for the fun of seeing the impossible come to life on the screen.

China Heavyweight,Jeannette Catsoulis,77,80,"Illustrating the film's rags-to-ring narrative with panoramic mountain views and compact shots of young bodies punching their way up the food chain, Mr. Sun straddles ancient and modern, tranquillity and turmoil, with equal sureness.","Jul  5, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/china-heavyweight/details
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,Manohla Dargis,57,80,"Mr. Burton, whose artistry is at times most evident in its filigree, can be a great collector when given the right box to fill, as is the case here. He revels in the story’s icky, freaky stuff; he’s right at home, which may be why he seems liberated by its labyrinthine turns and why you don’t care if you get a little lost in them.","Sep 29, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children/details

Len and Company,Andy Webster,60,80,"Len and Company...never strains for profundity. Instead, it savors observational subtleties, especially in Mr. Ifans’s assured performance.

Three,Glenn Kenny,71,80,"When the tension finally does break, the movie goes a little nuts, in venerable Johnnie To tradition.

Ali,Elvis Mitchell,65,80,"We see the movie levitate when Ali and Brown chant, ""Float like a butterfly,"" the slogan that takes on a different meaning in each context, starting off as hopeful and spry, finally becoming rueful and pointed.

The Age of Innocence,Vincent Canby,83,80,"Ms. Pfeifer is lovely, the visual focal point of the film, but also much more.

Manifesto,Glenn Kenny,72,80,"As an oblique examination and critique of political and art history and their various interactions over the 20th century, Manifesto is both witty and provocative.

Diamonds Are Forever,Vincent Canby,59,80,"Diamonds Are Forever is great, absurd fun, not only because it recalls the moods and manners of the sixties (which, being over, now seem safely comprehensible), but also because all of the people connected with the movie obviously know what they are up to.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/diamonds-are-forever/details
Desperately Seeking Susan,Vincent Canby,71,80,"Desperately Seeking Susan, based on a good screenplay by a new writer named Leora Barish, is a terrifically genial New York City farce in which the lives of two very different young women become tangled in an Orlon web of lies, half-truths and cross purposes. Full of funny, sharply observed details, reflected in Santo Loquasto's witty production design as well as in all of the dozens of individual performances.

The Road Warrior,Vincent Canby,76,80,"In its stripped-down, cannily cinematic way, it's one of the most imaginative Australian films yet released in this country.

Life Is Beautiful,Elvis Mitchell,59,80,"Benigni effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage.

The Riot Club,Stephen Holden,54,80,"Lone Scherfig (“An Education”), the Danish filmmaker who directed the movie from a screenplay by Ms. Wade, has coaxed wonderfully nasty performances from a young cast.","Mar 26, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-riot-club/details
Blind Date,Janet Maslin,49,80,"Blind Date is farce of a traditional and even old-fashioned sort, but Mr. Edwards's complete enthusiasm for the form creates a comic style so avid that it's slightly surreal. Comic possibilities are everywhere in Blind Date, and the tireless Mr. Edwards leaves none of them unexploited.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blind-date-1987/details
Cliffhanger,Elvis Mitchell,60,80,"All of the performers are upstaged by the film's breathtaking backdrop, and by the fast and furious way Renny Harlin, the director, approaches action sequences.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cliffhanger/details
The Man Who Saved the World,Daniel M. Gold,55,80,"I was just at the right place at the right time,” Mr. Petrov says, a simple truth that becomes shocking when considering the alternative.

The Death of Louis XIV,Glenn Kenny,76,80,"[Mr. Léaud's] riveting, and a little alarming.

Rebels of the Neon God,A.O. Scott,82,80,"Mr. Tsai typically uses narrative as a tool for exploring the moods and meanings that link his characters with one another and with the city that awakens, contains and frustrates their desires.

Leviathan,Manohla Dargis,92,80,"The director, Andrey Zvyagintsev, has a heavenly eye but a leaden hand, and his movie is as heavy as it is transporting, filled with stirring shots of the natural world and deep dives into a human realm flooded with tears and vodka.","Dec 24, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/leviathan-2014/details
Cowards Bend the Knee or The Blue Hands,Manohla Dargis,82,80,"There is also something rather splendid about this extended-play peep show, as if Mr. Maddin had stumbled across a hitherto lost archive of cinema's less-than-innocent past. What makes all this nostalgia for a movie history that never happened is that, as is always the case with Mr. Maddin's work, it's executed with more love than irony and not a whit of derision.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cowards-bend-the-knee-or-the-blue-hands/details

Rubber,Manohla Dargis,59,80,"While it can be seen as an environmental horror movie (if you must), Rubber doesn't dig down but instead merrily rolls on, as Mr. Dupieux plays with narrative and form. In one wonderful cinematic coup the tire spots a crow and shifts toward the bird so that it's framed in the tire hole, an angle that turns the tire into a camera. Point. Click.

A League of Their Own,Vincent Canby,67,80,"Though big of budget, A League of Their Own is one of the year's most cheerful, most relaxed, most easily enjoyable comedies.

The House I Live In,Manohla Dargis,77,80,"It's easy to take issue with a documentary like The House I Live In, which tackles too much in too brief a time and glosses over complexities, yet this is also a model of the ambitious, vitalizing activist work that exists to stir the sleeping to wake.","Oct  4, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-house-i-live-in/details
The Mermaid,Glenn Kenny,69,80,"While second-guessing the marketing strategies of movie conglomerates is happily not the concern of this reviewer, it does seem a shame that this exhilarating, bizarre, good-hearted, blatantly obvious sci-fi-fantasy-slapstick eco-fable isn’t getting wider fanfare.","Feb 20, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-mermaid/details

Patriot Games,Janet Maslin,64,80,"The fierce-looking Sean Bean is outstandingly good as Ryan's main antagonist, and Patrick Bergin brings the right air of calculation to the terrorist mastermind he plays. Several of the film's main sequences, like an encounter between Mr. Bean's Sean Miller and David Threlfall as the police inspector who has been his captor, derive their horror from the looks of pure loathing that these terrorists bestow upon their prey.","Jun 29, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/patriot-games/details
Don't Think Twice,Stephen Holden,83,80,"Don’t Think Twice, which has a warm heart, could have been a much nastier movie.

Blackhat,Manohla Dargis,51,80,"Michael Mann’s thriller Blackhat, a story about the intersection of bodies and machines, is a spectacular work of unhinged moviemaking. By turns brutal and sentimental, lovely and lurid, as serious as the grave and blissfully preposterous, it combines a truckload of plot with many of the obsessions, tropes, sights and sounds that distinguish his other movies.","Jan 15, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blackhat/details

Nighthawks,Janet Maslin,56,80,"We've seen movies like Nighthawks before, but we haven't seen one in a while. That may be why this police film, with an international cast and a plot about international terrorism, has so much punch. All of it is standard stuff, and yet Nighthawks has been assembled with enough pep to make it feel fresh. It is particularly helped by the performances of Rutger Hauer, a Dutch actor who makes a startling impression as a cold-blooded fiend, and Sylvester Stallone, from whom less is definitely more.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/nighthawks/details

Lung Neaw Visits His Neighbours,Stephen Holden,tbd,80,"This 2 ½-hour film, which is described by Mr. Tiravanija as ""not a documentary and not a narrative"" but ""more of a portraiture,"" rewards concentration once you adjust to its glacial pace and its radically minimalist aesthetic.

Boarding Gate,Manohla Dargis,47,80,"Even in Boarding Gate, a modestly scaled, self-consciously tawdry exercise in genre appropriation, Mr. Assayas manages to say more about what it is to be human -- to desire, to fear, to be alone -- than most filmmakers say in a lifetime.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/boarding-gate/details

Fresh Dressed,Jon Caramanica,69,80,"Much of this film is told through interviews: Mr. Kani is fascinating and also funny; Mr. Combs is cocksure; and Kanye West is appealingly hyper.

Michael Clayton,Manohla Dargis,82,80,"Mr. Gilroy hasn’t reinvented the legal thriller here, but I doubt that was his intention; at its best and most ambitious, the film plays less like a variation on a Hollywood standard than a reappraisal. It’s a modest reappraisal, adult, sincere, intelligent, absorbing; it entertains without shame.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/michael-clayton/details
Les Hautes Solitudes (1974),Manohla Dargis,tbd,80,"The film’s silence works as a kind of invitation, encouraging you to infer meaning and jump to conclusions as one image gives way to the next.","Feb 23, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/les-hautes-solitudes-1974/details

Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,Janet Maslin,65,80,"There are no signs of waning energy here, not even in an Enterprise crew that looks ever more ready for intergalactic rocking chairs.

The Man Without a Face,Janet Maslin,62,80,"The best that can be said about Mr. Gibson as a director -- and this is no mean achievement -- is that it's often possible to forget he was the man behind the camera.

The Far Side of the Moon,Manohla Dargis,76,80,"Based on Mr. Lepage's play of the same title, Far Side of the Moon carries traces of the theater both in some of the dialogue and in its schematic construction.

Mountain Patrol,Manohla Dargis,77,80,"Films about environmental catastrophes tend to wax preachy, putting pedagogy and scolding above art. This one, for all its sorrow and the throb of righteous anger it provokes (only about 50,000 antelopes remain), is more than anything a work of creative imagination.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mountain-patrol/details
The PianoTuner of EarthQuakes,Jeannette Catsoulis,66,80,"Flaunting elements of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Island of Lost Souls,"" the movie, with its haunting, claustrophobic environment, allows the living and the merely lifelike to interact with an eerie beauty.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-pianotuner-of-earthquakes/details
Head Games,A.O. Scott,69,80,Head Games gains credibility and power from compassion for athletes and respect for their accomplishments.

Wind,Vincent Canby,57,80,"Wind is not commonplace movie making. The sailing sequences, including one short, very funny race off Newport involving the kind of small boats you and I might sail, surpass anything I've ever seen on the screen. There are collisions at sea, wrecked spinnakers and freak accidents, like the one during a race when a sailor finds himself hanging upside down from the mast as the other boat gains. These things exhilarate as they threaten to stop the heart.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/wind/details
Guilty of Romance,Miriam Bale,56,80,"Most disturbing and fascinating is the mixture of Izumi’s liberation with her degradation in this film, which plays like a more horrific version of David Lynch’s “Mullholland Drive.”","Mar 13, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/guilty-of-romance/details

Appropriate Behavior,Stephen Holden,73,80,"For all its disorganization and lack of an ending or even a sense of direction, Appropriate Behavior is alive.

"Life, Above All",Manohla Dargis,65,80,"A grave and quietly moving story about a South African girl of extraordinary character, does something that few painful dramas accomplish: It tells a tale of resilience without platitudes about the triumph of the human spirit or without false promises about an unclouded future.","Jul 14, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-above-all/details
Boys on the Side,Elvis Mitchell,61,80,"What matters more is that Ms. Goldberg, along with her co-stars Mary-Louise Parker and Drew Barrymore, is so sharp, funny and wholehearted that this film creates an unexpected groundswell of real emotion.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/boys-on-the-side/details
Frank,A.O. Scott,75,80,"Mr. Abrahamson’s main achievement, enabled by the sensitive and resourceful cast, is to find a tone that is funny without flippancy, sincere without turning to mush.","Aug 14, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/frank/details

Me and You and Everyone We Know,Dana Stevens,76,80,"Though her movie has a clear narrative line, and might even be classified as romantic comedy, it is also a meticulously constructed visual artifact, diffidently introducing the playful, rebus-like qualities of installation art to the conventions of narrative cinema.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/me-and-you-and-everyone-we-know/details
Train to Busan,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,80,"Often chaotic but never disorienting, the movie’s spirited set pieces — like a wriggling ribbon of undead clinging doggedly to the last compartment — owe much to Lee Hyung-deok’s wonderfully agile cinematography.","Jul 21, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/train-to-busan/details

Creepy,Manohla Dargis,76,80,"Creepy certainly works — looks and feels — like a horror movie, but it also has the conundrums of a detective story, the emotional currents of a domestic drama and the quickening pulse of a psychological thriller, a combination that creates a kind of destabilization.","Oct 20, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/creepy/details

Night Catches Us,A.O. Scott,65,80,"Ms. Hamilton tells a modest, complex story with admirable clarity and nuance.

Julia,Manohla Dargis,62,80,"Ms. Swinton demands to be seen even when her character is on a self-annihilating bender so real that you can almost smell the stink rising off her.

The Big Red One (re-release),Vincent Canby,77,80,"The Big Red One, for all its uncompromising brutality, is viscerally, angrily alive. Fuller was lucky to survive the war.

Bobby Fischer Against the World,A.O.

How to Survive a Plague,Stephen Holden,86,80,"In the words of Mr. Kramer: ""The government didn't get us the drugs. No one else got us the drugs. We, Act Up, got those drugs out there.

Bright Young Things,Dana Stevens,64,80,"Waugh's dialogue, effortlessly catching the lockjaw intonations and facetious mannerisms of the British aristocracy between the world wars, is a gift to screenwriters and performers alike.

Himizu,Miriam Bale,66,80,"Mr. Sono uses sound, a low, grumbling noise like an earthquake, to convey this chaos. He also gives the film a harrowing cacophony and a sense of trauma with sound effects, including subtle echoes.","Mar 13, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/himizu/details
Funny Ha Ha,Dana Stevens,78,80,"It is a small, plain movie, shot in 16 millimeter in dull locations around Boston; but also, like its passive, quizzical heroine, it is unexpectedly seductive, and even, in its own stubborn, hesitant way, beautiful.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/funny-ha-ha/details

Hard Eight,Stephen Holden,78,80,"The role of Jimmy is one of Mr. Jackson's scarier characters, and this brilliant actor inhabits all four corners of his jittery, avaricious personality.

Closed Curtain,A.O. Scott,81,80,"On one level, the film (or nonfilm; it was shot on digital video and partly with smartphone cameras) is a mischievous, Pirandellian entertainment.

Broadcast News,Vincent Canby,84,80,"Mr. Brooks's screenplay overstates matters both at the beginning of the film and at the end, with a prologue that strains to be cute and an epilogue that is just unnecessary.

Chapter & Verse,Glenn Kenny,70,80,"The movie’s wide-screen framing, ruthless plot reversals and say-what-you-mean writing sometimes recall a master of socially conscious cinema from another era, Sam Fuller.

The Cats of Mirikitani,Jeannette Catsoulis,73,80,"The result is a movie that evolves naturally from the filmmaker's compassion for her subject; as much as possible, she remains off camera, and her immense act of charity is never permitted to become the film's focus.

Canners,A.O. Scott,72,80,"Canners is a testament to its director’s indefatigable humanism, and to the human beings who feed it. The movie follows the money, a nickel at a time, and discovers something far more valuable.","Mar  9, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/canners/details

The Winslow Boy,Elvis Mitchell,79,80,"Mamet's handsome, stately adaptation of Terence Rattigan's play The Winslow Boy does not embellish upon its source material.

I've Loved You So Long,A.O. Scott,79,80,"A revelation comes near the end that is both tremendously moving and a bit disappointing, in the way that the solutions to great mysteries frequently are. This turn does not diminish the accomplishment of Ms. Scott Thomas's deep, subtle and altogether stunning performance, but it does alter the scale of the movie, turning it into a more manageable, less existentially unsettling drama.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ive-loved-you-so-long/details

Bad News Bears,Manohla Dargis,65,80,"Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and buoyed by fine supporting work from Greg Kinnear and Marcia Gay Harden, the director's latest effort won't rock your movie world, but the fact that he manages to keep the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bad-news-bears/details

High Ground,Jeannette Catsoulis,77,80,"Michael Brown (a renowned mountaineer), digs below the adventure itself to reveal the gaping holes in our veteran care.

Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,Manohla Dargis,78,80,"Its one-week theatrical run will make it eligible for Academy Award consideration, though given that organization's often pitiful record when it comes to nonfiction film, it seems unlikely that a movie this subtly intelligent would make its short list.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/roman-polanski-wanted-and-desired/details

Femme Fatale,Dana Stevens,59,80,"The story, to the extent that it is comprehensible, is pretentious and banal, closer to ""Vanilla Sky"" than ""Notorious.""

Free Angela & All Political Prisoners,Nicolas Rapold,73,80,"Shola Lynch’s documentary about Angela Davis, the activist and beacon of counterculture radicalism, is a snappily edited, archivally wallpapered recollection of fearless behavior in the face of an antsy establishment.

Night on Earth,Vincent Canby,68,80,"With this, his fourth commercially released feature, Mr. Jarmusch again demonstrates his mastery of comedy of the oblique.
He seems to see his characters through a telescope, while attending to their talk with some kind of long-range listening device.

Hair,Vincent Canby,68,80,"A rollicking musical memoir, as much a recollection of the show as of the period, a film that has the charm of a fable and the slickness of Broadway show biz at its breathless best.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hair/details
If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front,Stephen Holden,65,80,"The film's sobriety and carefully balanced arguments make it an exemplary piece of reporting, although its emotional heat rarely rises to a boil.","Jun 21, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/if-a-tree-falls-a-story-of-the-earth-liberation-front/details
SherryBaby,Dana Stevens,66,80,"What distinguishes the film from its many peers is the quality of Ms. Collyer’s writing -- which rarely reaches for obvious, melodramatic beats -- and the precision of Ms. Gyllenhaal’s performance. She treats the character neither as a case study nor as an opportunity to show off her range, but rather as a completely ordinary and therefore arrestingly complicated person.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sherrybaby/details
On the Beach at Night Alone,A.O.

The Duke of Burgundy,A.O. Scott,87,80,"In the end there is nothing especially campy about “The Duke of Burgundy,” which neither mocks its heroines nor the breathless, naughty screen tradition to which they belong.

Armadillo,A.O. Scott,72,80,"The achievement of this film is to forestall and complicate easy judgment. You emerge shaken and bothered, which may sound like a reason not to see the movie. It is actually the opposite.","Apr 14, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/armadillo/details

Springtime in a Small Town,Stephen Holden,86,80,"As Mark Li Ping-bing's beautiful cinematography observes the change of season, the movie becomes a broader meditation on rebirth, and how, in the language of T.

Sound of Noise,David DeWitt,72,80,"What follows is a character study mixed with outlandish crime procedural.

Gimme the Loot,A.O. Scott,81,80,"Gimme the Loot has a lot to say about the contradictions of a place that is defined by both abundant opportunity and ferocious inequality.

The Hedgehog,Stephen Holden,64,80,"At times The Hedgehog suggests a Gallic ""Harold and Maude,"" with an intellectual gloss as it celebrates the life force passed from an older generation to a younger. But its concept of vitality isn't the popular cliché of kicking up your heels, breathing deeply and gorging on ice cream.

Bestiaire,Manohla Dargis,71,80,"This may not be a fuzzy wuzzy, warm-and-cuddly song to animals, but in revealing the everyday, sometimes repellent surrealism of the park - where zebras, elephants, camels and ostriches walk among slowly moving cars, and lions bang wildly against their small cages - he forces you to look at the often unseen.

Deep Sea,Laura Kern,78,80,"The soothing voices of Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet provide the informative yet often uninspired narration.

Midnight Cowboy,Vincent Canby,79,80,"Midnight Cowboy often seems to be exploiting its material for sensational or comic effect, but it is ultimately a moving experience that captures the quality of a time and a place. It's not a movie for the ages, but, having seen it, you won't ever again feel detached as you walk down West 42d Street, avoiding the eyes of the drifters, stepping around the little islands of hustlers, and closing your nostrils to the smell of rancid griddles.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/midnight-cowboy/details
Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck,Mike Hale,83,80,"Mr. Morgen was given access to Cobain’s archives — “art, music, journals, Super 8 films and audio montages” — and his exhilarating, exhausting, two-hour-plus film, both an artful mosaic and a hammering barrage, reflects years of rummaging through that trove.","Apr 23, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kurt-cobain-montage-of-heck/details

Ghost Bird,Neil Genzlinger,68,80,"Generally speaking, bird-watching is a pastime that is extremely interesting to a few people and not at all interesting to anyone else.

"I Love You, Daddy",Manohla Dargis,56,80,"“Zama” and I Love You, Daddy are two of the best movies I saw at the Toronto International Film Festival, which ends Sunday, and they could not be more different or more unwittingly in sync.... A brutally and often uncomfortably funny comedy, it dances around female victimization and male exploitation, and plays with the ostensibly blurry line between the personal and the public. That makes it feel like a near-documentary about the entertainment industry, as well as a kick-me sign pinned squarely on its creator’s white, male, middle-aged posterior.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-love-you-daddy/details
Young Guns,Janet Maslin,50,80,"Young Guns is best watched in the playful, none-too-serious spirit in which it was made.

Hombre,Bosley Crowther,80,80,"Hombre seems constantly meaning to have something vital to say, maybe about racial antagonisms, that it can't quite sputter out because it has so much to do.

Out of the Furnace,Manohla Dargis,63,80,"It’s a heavy, solemn tale of blood ties that turns into a melodramatic gusher filled with abstractions about masculinity, America and violence, but brought to specific, exciting life by Christian Bale, Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson.","Dec  3, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/out-of-the-furnace/details

Wait Until Dark,Bosley Crowther,81,80,"Once this build-up is accomplished—once the sinister plot is launched and the young woman suddenly realizes that she has been duped and is in grave peril—the shock and suspense of the situation hit the audience with almost the same force, I'd imagine, as they evidently hit her.

And Mr. Anderson’s eye for local color — the red-orange-yellow end of the spectrum in particular — is meticulous and admiring.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-darjeeling-limited/details
My Life as a Zucchini,A.O. Scott,85,80,"Mr. Barras’s film, with its bigheaded, asymmetrical modeling-clay figures and off-kilter picture-book backdrops, explores a harsh situation with gentle whimsy.","Feb 23, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/my-life-as-a-zucchini/details

Queen and Country,A.O. Scott,68,80,"Queen and Country doesn’t quite have the bittersweet intensity of its precursor.

The Martian,Manohla Dargis,80,80,"Mr. Damon’s Everyman quality (he’s our Jimmy Stewart) helps scale the story down, but what makes this epic personal is Mr. Scott’s filmmaking, in which every soaring aerial shot of the red planet is answered by the intimate landscape of a face.","Oct  1, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-martian/details

Leonard Cohen: Bird on a Wire,Glenn Kenny,79,80,"The movie is a worthy time capsule and a must for Cohen devotees.

Apocalypse Now,Vincent Canby,94,80,"Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now lives up to its grand title, disclosing not only the various faces of war but also the contradictions between excitement and boredom, terror and pity, brutality and beauty.

Warrior of Light,Stephen Holden,70,80,"It would be foolish for a middle-class do-gooder confronting homeless children on the streets of Rio de Janeiro to expect conventional morality to have any meaning to them at all.

Paul Williams Still Alive,Andy Webster,72,80,"Mr. Williams's quiet integrity trumps Mr. Kessler at every turn.

The Anthropologist,Neil Genzlinger,tbd,80,"At this point no documentarian can possibly have a fresh take on climate change, right? Wrong.

District 9,A.O.

Félix And Meira,Jeannette Catsoulis,66,80,"Tiny advances in seduction — like a direct gaze, or the eventual removal of that wig — assume the power of full-on sexual collisions, and Ms. Yaron, with her restlessly darting eyes, easily conveys Meira’s sensual deprivation.","Apr 16, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/felix-and-meira/details
The Buffalo Boy,Manohla Dargis,72,80,"One of the strengths of Mr. Nguyen-Vo's film is that despite the overwhelming physical beauty of the landscape and the simplicity of his characters, he doesn't succumb to such aerated thinking.

Cleopatra,Bosley Crowther,60,80,"Forget the length of time it took to make it and all the tattle of troubles they had, including the behavior of two of its spotlighted stars. The memorable thing about this picture is that it is a surpassing entertainment, one of the great epic films of our day.

The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi,Dana Stevens,75,80,"Like many musicals, The Blind Swordsman works better in individual scenes than as a whole.

Here,Stephen Holden,68,80,"Here, to its detriment, never builds its ideas into a cohesive vision. The screenplay by Mr. King and Dani Valent too often wanders off into poetic vagueness.

Ikland,Jeannette Catsoulis,tbd,70,"Narrating as he goes, his humor as warm and dry as the ground beneath his feet, Mr. Soling is an unconventional explorer whose interactions with the long-suffering Ik - the women quiet and watchful, the men seamed and talkative - are politely deferential.

The Last Temptation of Christ,Janet Maslin,80,70,"despite such maladroit moments, The Last Temptation of Christ finally exerts enormous power.

Far from the Madding Crowd,A.O. Scott,71,70,"The most obvious thing to say about Far From the Madding Crowd is also the most bizarre, given the source material. It’s buoyant, pleasant and easygoing.

Better Living Through Circuitry,Stephen Holden,70,70,"The movie is essentially pro-Ecstasy.

Mean Creek,Dana Stevens,74,70,Like an uncommonly artful and well-acted after-school special.

Beetle Queen Conquers Tokyo,Mike Hale,75,70,"The diverting Beetle Queen, like “Lost in Translation” or Takashi Murakami’s art, says less about Japan than it does about America’s continuing fascination with modern Japanese culture.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/beetle-queen-conquers-tokyo/details
War of the Worlds,Dana Stevens,73,70,"Acting is not really the point of this movie, which seems to arise above all from Mr. Spielberg's desire to reaffirm that he is, along with everything else, a master of pure action filmmaking.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/war-of-the-worlds/details
The Limey,Janet Maslin,73,70,"Among Soderbergh's widely varied films (""sex, lies and videotape,"" ""Kafka,"" ""The Underneath,"" ""Schizopolis,"" ""Out of Sight""), this one actually has the best chance of becoming anyone's sentimental favorite.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-limey/details

The Taiwan Oyster,Ken Jaworowski,73,70,"Part romance, existential meditation and dark comedy, the film, like its perplexed characters, isn’t always certain of what it wants to be.

Off-White Lies,Jeannette Catsoulis,50,70,"Poised unwaveringly between gentle comedy and delicate drama, Maya Kenig's Off White Lies keeps a lot to itself.

The Battle of Pussy Willow Creek,Andy Webster,52,70,"By the time the humor overreaches, escalating into the surreal, you’ve fallen under the movie’s spell.

Tales of the Night,Andy Webster,66,70,"The narratives - involving princesses, sorcerers, dragons, talking animals - are familiar.

Days of Thunder,Janet Maslin,60,70,"Tony Scottmdoes his utmost to pump up the audience's adrenaline at all times, which means that the film's big moments - the races, the crashes, the news that someone needs brain surgery - don't seem that different from the small ones.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/days-of-thunder/details
The Wannabe,Andy Webster,49,70,"Mr. Piazza offers a persuasive portrait of decline, but it is the crumbling beauty and flailing hopes of Rose that resonate.

Scott Walker: 30 Century Man,Stephen Holden,65,70,"In a movie that avoids examining Mr. Walker’s personal history, there are hints of a man struggling with chronic depression and problems with alcohol, but they are only hints.

No Man's Land,Stephen Holden,84,70,One of the movie's dark running jokes is that everyone seems to speak a different language and has trouble communicating.

Nas: Time Is Illmatic,Nicolas Rapold,72,70,"Despite some conventional moves here and there and a weakness for the cult of genius, the documentary sustains that uneasy mood cast by Nas’s expression as a child on the “Illmatic” cover, sobered by experience and wisdom before his time.","Sep 30, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/nas-time-is-illmatic/details
The Method,,68,70,"The sum total of this gamesmanship is a suspenseful, funny film that touches on a corporation’s responsibility to society, the price of ambition, the persistence of workplace sexism, the destructive competition between women, and why it’s a good idea to take an extra shirt to your next interview.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-method/details
Anything Else,Dana Stevens,43,70,"Small-scale and loose.

Slumdog Millionaire,Manohla Dargis,86,70,"In the end, what gives me reluctant pause about this bright, cheery, hard-to-resist movie is that its joyfulness feels more like a filmmaker's calculation than an honest cry from the heart about the human spirit (or, better yet, a moral tale).",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/slumdog-millionaire/details
Strange Powers: Stephin Merritt and the Magnetic Fields,Mike Hale,66,70,"In her director's statement for Strange Powers: Stephin Merritt and the Magnetic Fields, Gail O'Hara writes that ""this one's for the fans.""

Pop Aye,Manohla Dargis,73,70,"They make a funny pair, by turns amusing and puzzling, though also melancholic and touching.

Pina,A.O. Scott,83,70,"The cumulative effect is exhilarating and also a bit frustrating, since so many dances are included and woven together the audience does not have the chance to experience any single work in its entirety.

In the Land of Blood and Honey,Manohla Dargis,56,70,"Both Ms. Marjanovic and Mr. Kostic are very fine (like the rest of the cast they deliver their dialogue in Bosnian) and they navigate the contradictions of their characters' feelings, the flashes of hate, the surrender to desire, with delicacy.","Dec 22, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-the-land-of-blood-and-honey/details

The Art of Getting By,A.O.

Without the King,Jeannette Catsoulis,55,70,"The film, fluidly shot by James Adolphus, remains deeply sensitive to the complexities of a culture whose attachment to monarchy contravenes its best interests. This dilemma is gradually becoming clear to Princess Sikhanyiso, the oldest of the king's 22 children and a student in California.

Amistad,Elvis Mitchell,63,70,"Dwarfed by the enormity of what it means to illustrate, the diffuse Amistad divides its energies among many concerns: the pain and strangeness of the captives' experience, the Presidential election in which they become a factor, the stirrings of civil war, and the great many bewhiskered abolitionists and legal representatives who argue about their fate.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/amistad/details

The Flintstones,Caryn James,38,70,The greatest lost opportunity in The Flintstones is that its writers (more than 30) are so faithful to the 60's television series that they failed to add enough updated pop-culture references.

Bone Tomahawk,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,70,"Mr. Russell is far from the only reason to see this unexpected low-budget treat, a witty fusion of western, horror and comedy that gallops to its own beat.

Destination Unknown,Glenn Kenny,75,70,"Ms. Ferguson’s film does not seem to have a particular organizing principle at first. These survivors do not necessarily know one another.

Hipsters,Stephen Holden,67,70,"Who knows if anything remotely resembling the culture of Hipsters really existed? It's a musical, after all. In any case this movie, which won the 2009 Nika (the Russian Oscar) for best picture, is an endearing curiosity that, at 125 minutes, is as badly in need of a trim as the hair of its comically coiffed dandies.","Feb 23, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hipsters/details

A Poem Is a Naked Person,A.O. Scott,76,70,"This film, commissioned by Mr. Russell and directed by Les Blank, is among other things a strange and gorgeous artifact of its moment.

Brick Lane,A.O. Scott,61,70,"Certainly touching, even heart-rending at times, and it mostly steers clear of the didacticism and sentimentality its subject matter often invites.

Francofonia,A.O.

Paradise: Faith,Stephen Holden,61,70,"Like it or not, Paradise: Faith sticks in your head.

People I Know,Stephen Holden,53,70,"Would like to think of itself as a film on the edge, a contemporary descendant of ""Sweet Smell of Success.""

The Importance of Being Earnest,Stephen Holden,60,70,"For all its distractions and additions, The Importance of Being Earnest is still a reasonably entertaining costume comedy.

Lonely Hearts,Stephen Holden,60,70,"As fictional characters in a movie that is fetishistic in its attention to period detail, Mr. Leto and Ms. Hayek work well together as an unsavory couple two rungs down the social ladder from Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in ""Double Indemnity.""",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lonely-hearts/details
I Used to Be Darker,Jeannette Catsoulis,69,70,"Mr. Porterfield might sometimes be too subtle for his own good, but by taking us on a low-key ramble through the ever-shifting feelings of a fractured family, he has woven a dreamy, detached chronicle of dissolution and renewal.","Oct  3, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-used-to-be-darker/details

Elf,Dana Stevens,64,70,"A charming, silly family Christmas movie more likely to spread real joy than migraine, indigestion and sugar shock. The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky, gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/elf/details

Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,Janet Maslin,55,70,"Leonard Nimoy, who directed this third installment, hasn't matched the playfulness and energy of ''Star Trek II,'' but he's way ahead of the first film, making up in earnestness what he lacks in style.

The Lake House,Dana Stevens,52,70,"The movie is, above all, a showcase for its stars, who seem gratifyingly comfortable in their own skin and delighted to be in each other's company again, in another deeply silly, effortlessly entertaining movie.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lake-house/details
The Student,Rachel Saltz,70,70,"Pitched somewhere between allegory and documentary, the film looks at its characters in a dispassionate, almost deadpan way. They’re something more than specimens under glass but something less than fully rounded people.","Aug 21, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-student/details
Let's Go to Prison,Neil Genzlinger,27,70,"It takes a while to realize that this is actually a sly, very funny comedy, one that stays admirably deadpan every time you think it’s about to veer into gross-out territory.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lets-go-to-prison/details
Extraordinary Tales,Jeannette Catsoulis,59,70,"Harnessing a range of appropriately spooky-oddball narrators and striking visual styles — including graphic novels, early photography and Expressionist painting — the Spanish director and animator Raul Garcia simultaneously honors and reimagines.","Oct 22, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/extraordinary-tales/details
Father of the Bride,Janet Maslin,51,70,"The screenplay represents recycling at its best. The material has been successfully refurbished with new jokes and new attitudes, but the earlier film's most memorable moments have been preserved.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/father-of-the-bride/details
Ira & Abby,Jeannette Catsoulis,62,70,"Though playing at times like an extended sitcom, Ira & Abby radiates a breathless charm, due in no small part to Ms. Westfeldt’s sharp dialogue and engagingly unmannered performance.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ira-abby/details
Six Days Seven Nights,Elvis Mitchell,51,70,"Ms. Heche and Mr. Ford make an appealing, wisecracking team, and they look comfortable with the rugged demands of their roles.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/six-days-seven-nights/details

Brotherhood,Neil Genzlinger,52,70,"The script, by Mr. Canon and Doug Simon, eventually strains credulity - even frat boys aren't this dumb - but Mr. Canon, in his first feature, shows a great knack for keeping things moving.

World War Z,A.O. Scott,63,70,"World War Z often feels smaller and quieter than it is, because your attention is drawn to details and moments rather than to showstopping spectacles or self-important themes.","Jun 20, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/world-war-z/details
"The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio",Stephen Holden,58,70,"Gently, affectionately and with wit, this lovely movie gives the 1950's its due, but not for a moment does it go overboard and make you want to go back there.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-prize-winner-of-defiance-ohio/details
Being Evel,Andy Webster,72,70,The movie overreaches when trying to contextualize Knievel as a hero inspiring the country after Vietnam-Watergate disillusionment. He was simply an all-American self-promoter. But Being Evel largely nails his story.,"Aug 20, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/being-evel/details
The Purge: Anarchy,Manohla Dargis,50,70,"Kill or be killed isn’t the official tag line of The Purge: Anarchy, but it fits.

Baadasssss!,Dave Kehr,75,70,"Mario Van Peebles, of course, inhabits a very different world from that of his father: a world that his father, in some small way, helped to create. It is his awareness of this paradox, of the progressive import of his father's film and of the repressive import of his father's personality, that informs this modest but interesting work.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gettin-the-mans-foot-outta-your-baadasssss!/details

Land of Plenty,Dana Stevens,62,70,"Land of Plenty, is like a clumsy, well-meaning intervention in a family quarrel.

Workingman's Death,Stephen Holden,67,70,"In the film's production notes, Mr. Glawogger wonders, ""Is heavy manual labor disappearing or is it just becoming invisible?""

Passage to Mars,Ken Jaworowski,43,70,"While those seeking interplanetary scenarios may want more details, fans of endurance stories will be pleased.

My Mother Likes Women,Stephen Holden,51,70,"As My Mother Likes Women gallops along, it picks up speed and takes its characters on a whirlwind tour of Prague before rushing back home.

Career Girls,Janet Maslin,76,70,"There is the sense that Mr. Leigh, whose unusual collaborative method with actors is an essential facet of his writing and direction, is too willing to confuse tics with truth. Indeed, this time the actors' solipsism is more apparent.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/career-girls/details
Café Lumière,Dana Stevens,80,70,"Café Lumière stands in relation to ""Tokyo Story"" as a faint, diminished echo.

Phar Lap,Janet Maslin,55,70,The movie Phar Lap is as much of a crowd pleaser as the champion Australian race horse for whom it is named. In a gently rousing style that should appeal in equal measure to adults and children.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/phar-lap/details
Hollywood Homicide,Dana Stevens,47,70,"He (Ford) slips into the role as if it were a pair of well-worn loafers, the left inherited from Peter Falk, the right from Clint Eastwood, and then proceeds, with wry nonchalance, to tap-dance, shuffle and pirouette through his loosest, wittiest performance in years.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hollywood-homicide/details
Go Go Tales,Manohla Dargis,61,70,"A lovely drift of a movie, Go Go Tales commands your attention even as it lulls you along. Conspicuously inspired by John Cassavetes's ""Killing of a Chinese Bookie,"" among other touchstones, it is a sincere and inspired meditation on art and creation, but in a loose, funny key.","Jan  6, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/go-go-tales/details
Down in the Valley,Stephen Holden,65,70,"Begins semirealistically, then veers off course, hurtling into the wild blue yonder of myth and allegory. On the way to a climactic shootout that begins on the set of a Hollywood western and ends on a foggy hillside, it makes several screeching, hairpin turns.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/down-in-the-valley/details
Unconscious,Stephen Holden,59,70,"If Unconscious consistently overplays its hand, its fusion of a Sherlock Holmes-style detective story (Alma is the master sleuth, and Salvador her Dr. Watson) with a delirious bedroom farce in the spirit of early Pedro Almodóvar is frequently very funny.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/unconscious/details
Miss You Already,A.O. Scott,59,70,"To accuse it of being manipulative is like accusing it of being in color. The genre is melodrama. The assault on the tear ducts and heartstrings is part of the contract, and the movie more than holds up its end of the bargain.","Nov  5, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/miss-you-already/details
Actress,A.O. Scott,76,70,"Mr. Greene’s impressionistic style and rough, off-center compositions create an atmosphere of intimacy, as if the viewer were being invited to read Ms. Burre’s diary or her mind.","Nov  6, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/actress/details
Pete Seeger: The Power of Song,A.O. Scott,81,70,"As the latest tribute -- Jim Brown’s loving documentary, Pete Seeger: The Power of Song -- makes clear, he’s still busy, still angry, still hopeful, still singing.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pete-seeger-the-power-of-song/details
Outsourced,,70,70,"In its modest way, Outsourced may be unique: a charming culture-clash romance that could be taught in business schools.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/outsourced/details
Together,Stephen Holden,60,70,"Together may not be overtly political, but its vision of contemporary Beijing, where brazen, fashion-crazed gold diggers like Lili bait their hooks to snare arrogant, slippery wheeler-dealers who end up playing her for a sucker, has bite.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/together/details
Valley of Love,Manohla Dargis,59,70,"This movie is finally only about Isabelle Huppert and Gérard Depardieu, and that’s enough.","Mar 24, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/valley-of-love/details
Free Men,A.O. Scott,58,70,"Hilali and Benghabrit were real people. Mr. Ferroukhi, who wrote the script with Alain-Michel Blanc, deftly interweaves their stories with the adventures of the fictional Younes, and so contributes a worthy and interesting chapter to the tradition of World War II dramas of conscience.","Mar 15, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/free-men/details
Asphalt Zahov,Dana Stevens,60,70,"The inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power, as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/asphalt-zahov/details
Ovation,Jeannette Catsoulis,tbd,70,"Dependably genuine, and suffused with Mr. Jaglom’s increasingly mellow intelligence, this lighthearted backstage drama will feel to his fans like a gathering of familiars.","Oct  6, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ovation/details
The Ambassador,A.O. Scott,67,70,"Mr. Brugger's portrait of shameless, routine collusion between exploitative foreigners and dysfunctional dictatorships is depressing and undeniable.
Unless, that is, The Ambassador is even more of a hoax than it seems to be. This strikes me as plausible, since somebody having this much fun in such proximity to horror may not be completely trustworthy.","Aug 28, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ambassador/details
Dark City,Stephen Holden,66,70,"So relentlessly trippy in a fun-house sort of way that it could very easily inspire a daredevil cult of moviegoers who go back again and again to experience its mind-bending twists and turns. Although its story doesn't add up when you analyze it afterward, the movie does take you on a visually arresting ride that offers many unsettling surprises right up to a sentimental sunburst of an ending that has a paranoid undertone.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dark-city/details
New World,Jeannette Catsoulis,58,70,"New World is both less bloody and more thoughtful than most of its genre, the shifting-alliances plot becoming more engrossing as it progresses.","Mar 21, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/new-world/details

A Song for Martin,Stephen Holden,72,70,"Watching it, I kept imagining the depth of feeling Ingmar Bergman and his troupe might have brought to the same material. As much as A Song for Martin hurts, it doesn't quite go the distance.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-song-for-martin/details
In Bloom,A.O. Scott,72,70,"The two lead performances — Lika Babluani as Eka and Mariam Bokeria as Natia — are direct and unaffected, but also enigmatic in the way that nonprofessional screen acting can be in the hands of a sensitive director.","Jan  9, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-bloom/details
Capitalism: A Love Story,Manohla Dargis,61,70,"Like most of his movies, Capitalism is a tragedy disguised as a comedy; it’s also an entertainment.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/capitalism-a-love-story/details

The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975,A.O. Scott,73,70,"The fact that the speakers' faces are never seen produces a feeling of estrangement that is crucial to the film's effectiveness. You become acutely aware of gaps and discontinuities: between slogans and realities, between political ideals and stubborn social problems, between then and now.","Sep  8, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-black-power-mixtape-1967-1975/details
The Painted Veil,Manohla Dargis,69,70,"Whether through craft or constitution, Mr. Norton invests Walter with a petty cruelty that makes his character’s emotional thaw and Kitty’s predicament all the more poignant.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-painted-veil/details
Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone,Andy Webster,69,70,"Today Mr. Fisher and Mr. Moore are all who remain of the original lineup, enduring a punishing touring schedule in 500-seat clubs.

Mama Africa,Stephen Holden,50,70,"What links these three stories besides their African settings is the calm, majestic presence of Queen Latifah, who introduces each one. The rapper, singer, actress and television personality towers over the movie, a stern but benign fortress of maternal common sense and wisdom.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mama-africa/details
Japanese Story,Dana Stevens,73,70,"Ultimately too thin for its length and too dependent on easy assumptions about its characters.

The Hangover,A.O. Scott,73,70,"But true to its title, The Hangover goes down smoothly enough and then kicks you in the head later on, when you start to examine the sources of your laughter.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hangover/details
Come Out and Play,Jeannette Catsoulis,44,70,"Stripped down and edited for disequilibrium rather than clarity, “Play” is less interested in pandering to gorehounds than in highlighting our reluctance to view children as anything other than innocent.","Mar 21, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/come-out-and-play/details
The Merchant of Venice,Dana Stevens,63,70,"Btter-than-average screen Shakespeare: intelligent without being showily clever, and motivated more by genuine fascination with the play's language and ideas than by a desire to cannibalize its author's cultural prestige.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-merchant-of-venice/details
Margarita Happy Hour,Dave Kehr,66,70,"Ms. Chaiken isn't much interested in melodramatic plot developments.

Go for It!,Andy Webster,44,70,"Best of all, Go for It! speaks to working-class young women without ignoring issues like race, class tensions and domestic violence.

Any Which Way You Can,Janet Maslin,51,70,"Any Which Way You Can is a loose, lighthearted Eastwood vehicle aimed at the good-timey sector of this actor's audience.

Gypsy,Stephen Holden,64,70,"The movie filmed with nonactors, doesn't try to counteract stereotypes of the Roma people as shiftless, thieving hustlers. But it goes a long way toward explaining the antisocial behavior.","Jun 26, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gypsy/details
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles,Nathan Lee,73,70,"A little uncanny (has it been digitally manipulated?) and a whole lot clichéd, the tableau speaks of melancholy graced by a pale sliver of hope.

When the Road Bends: Tales of a Gypsy Caravan,Manohla Dargis,73,70,"As a music document and as a labor of unabashed love, the nonfiction feature Gypsy Caravan could hardly be better; as a movie, it could stand some improvement.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/when-the-road-bends-tales-of-a-gypsy-caravan/details
Carrie,Manohla Dargis,53,70,"Ms. Peirce plays up the story’s religious themes and Carrie’s burgeoning power as she discovers her telekinetic gifts, even as the dread of the female body that deepens Mr. De Palma’s version somehow goes missing.","Oct 17, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/carrie/details
The Cat's Meow,Dana Stevens,63,70,"A modest, restrained picture, as small and satisfying as one of Woody Allen's better recent efforts.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-cats-meow/details
Married Life,Stephen Holden,65,70,"This is the sort of gallows humor that Hitchcock relished drawing out in cruelly amusing cat-and-mouse games, not to be taken too seriously.

Street Kings,Manohla Dargis,55,70,"It’s easy to laugh at Street Kings for its bigger than big emotions, its preposterously kinky narrative turns and overwrought jawing and yowling, but there’s no doubt that it also keeps you watching, really watching, all the way to the end.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/street-kings/details
Year of the Fish,Jeannette Catsoulis,53,70,"Packs more sadness than the familiar fairy tale but offers its own fantastical delights. Ye Xian's party dress, made of teardrops, suits her -- and her story -- perfectly.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/year-of-the-fish/details
Gerhard Richter - Painting,Rachel Saltz,77,70,"Gerhard Richter may not fling paint at the canvas, Jackson Pollock-style, but as Corinna Belz shows in her documentary Gerhard Richter Painting, he can be his own kind of action painter.","Mar 15, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gerhard-richter---painting/details
"Good Morning, Night",Dana Stevens,69,70,"At times Good Morning, Night feels as claustrophobic as the apartment itself, and you may feel that the director is handling his volatile material with a bit too much delicacy.

"Booye kafoor, atre yas",A.O. Scott,63,70,"Perhaps it's the difference in culture, but the thoughtfulness in Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine shows that its creator isn't letting himself or his audience off the hook.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/booye-kafoor-atre-yas/details

Antarctica: A Year on Ice,Nicolas Rapold,69,70,"The extremes of Antarctica: A Year on Ice might seem routine to fans of nature documentaries, but the photographer and director Anthony Powell produces some dazzling imagery in his droll study of isolation way, way down under.","Nov 28, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/antarctica-a-year-on-ice/details

Desert Riders,Jeannette Catsoulis,tbd,70,"Amid a cacophony of accusations and justifications, it’s the children’s broken limbs, ladderlike scars and disfigured, emaciated bodies that paradoxically hold the film together.","Apr 24, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/desert-riders/details
When Marnie Was There,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,70,"The conclusion is rushed and poorly staged, yet the damp caul of loneliness that envelops the film’s early scenes feels moving and true.","May 21, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/when-marnie-was-there/details

Abortion: Stories Women Tell,Helen T.

Man Up,Neil Genzlinger,69,70,"Man Up, a destined-for-romance story in the spirit of “You’ve Got Mail” and “Sleepless in Seattle,” has just enough edge to distinguish it from a Lifetime movie.

Rambo III,Janet Maslin,36,70,"Rambo's self-important, weight-of-the-world manner and his taste for political posturing would make him genuinely silly were they not counterbalanced by Mr. Stallone's startling, energetic physical presence and the film's stabs at self-mocking humor.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rambo-iii/details
Point Break,Janet Maslin,58,70,"Point Break, though it's anything but watertight where plotting is concerned, again reveals Ms. Bigelow's real talents as a director of fast-paced, high-adrenaline action.

The Third Miracle,Stephen Holden,55,70,"This intelligent, well-acted movie is not helped by the fact that its story in some ways parallels that of ""Stigmata,"" the trashy supernatural spookfest that flared briefly at the box office earlier this year.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-third-miracle/details

Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings,Jeannette Catsoulis,56,70,"The film’s questionable continuity, bargain-basement effects and overload of gay clichés may not be to everyone’s taste, but its queer-eye-for-the-undead-guy exuberance and warmth of spirit are irresistible.","Oct 24, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/remington-and-the-curse-of-the-zombadings/details

Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World,A.O. Scott,76,70,"The internet is an elusive quarry. It’s a marvel and a menace, a banal fact of life and a force for incalculable change.

The World's Fastest Indian,Stephen Holden,68,70,"This is a film that wears a smile button on its sleeve along with its happy heart.

Brighton Rock,Stephen Holden,57,70,"By discarding most of the theological debate, the movie is no longer a passion play but a gritty and despairing noir. That's good enough for me.","Aug 25, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/brighton-rock/details
Witness,Vincent Canby,76,70,"It's not really awful, but it's not much fun. It's pretty to look at and it contains a number of good performances, but there is something exhausting about its neat balancing of opposing manners and values.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/witness/details
Warsaw Uprising,Nicolas Rapold,tbd,70,"Warsaw Uprising is marred by a fictional audio drama among three characters (two cameraman brothers and an American airman) who provide an unnecessary, distracting and at times amateurish frame to this resourcefully, even wittily, edited tour.

Monsieur Ibrahim,Dana Stevens,69,70,"The two central performances help the lesson go down easily, and Mr. Duperyon's unassuming, slightly ragged realism gives the movie a sweet, lived-in charm. Mr. Sharif, grizzled and white-haired at 71, has lost none of the charisma that made him an international movie star in the 1960's, and Mr. Boulanger, in his first feature film, shows impressive self-assurance.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/monsieur-ibrahim/details

Something Better to Come,Neil Genzlinger,74,70,"Approach Something Better to Come with the same patience that the filmmaker exhibited in shooting it and you’ll be rewarded.

Herbie Fully Loaded,Stephen Holden,47,70,"A perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be this silly.

Joshy,Glenn Kenny,62,70,"Mr. Baena (who, with David O.

Circumstance,A.O.

In the Shadow of Women,A.O.

Outrage,Manohla Dargis,67,70,"Not everything is as elegantly executed, including a tiresome, would-be comic subplot involving an African diplomat and a clandestine casino that drags the story down badly and comes close to noxious racial stereotype.","Dec  1, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/outrage-1969/details
Trashed,Jeannette Catsoulis,71,70,"If we must talk trash, Mr. Irons - assisted by a scientist or two and Vangelis's doomy score - is an inspired choice of guide.

Fried Green Tomatoes,Janet Maslin,64,70,"Based on a novel by Fannie Flagg, the comedian, and directed by Jon Avnet, Fried Green Tomatoes has some good performances and a measure of homespun appeal, some of which can be credited to Elizabeth McBride's gently evocative costumes and Barbara Ling's detailed production design.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fried-green-tomatoes/details

G.I. Jane,Elvis Mitchell,62,70,"Mr. Scott's affinity for the visceral and strenuous, from ''Alien'' to ''Blade Runner'' to ''White Squall,'' is much more central here than the renegade feminism of his ''Thelma and Louise.''

The Band's Visit,Manohla Dargis,80,70,"Mr. Kolirin, it emerges, is wrenching comedy out of intense melancholia.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-bands-visit/details
A Housekeeper,Stephen Holden,68,70,"Fits squarely into a Gallic tradition of wistful, worldly-wise comedies that reflect on the weakness of the flesh.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-housekeeper/details
The New Rijksmuseum,A.O. Scott,66,70,"The film dwells on the logistical and bureaucratic details of the process, and if it does not exactly write a fresh chapter in the history of art, it stands as an exemplary study in the sociology of art administration.","Dec 17, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-new-rijksmuseum/details
Giant,Stephen Holden,64,70,"It is an appealing, gently comedic prologue to a love story.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/giant/details
After the Cup: Sons of Sakhnin United,Jeannette Catsoulis,62,70,"Never forgetting the rush of the game, the directors regularly serve up fleet footage of the team’s highs and lows, allowing the rhythms of the field to set the film’s volatile beat.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/after-the-cup-sons-of-sakhnin-united/details
Winter Solstice,Lawrence Van Gelder,59,70,"The boys, particularly Mr. Webber as Pete, are astonishingly good, and Ms. Monaghan, who looks like a slightly more tomboyish Liv Tyler, makes a deep impression in a minor role. Mr. LaPaglia, of the television series ""Without a Trace,"" brings a tender gravity to the shell-shocked Jim.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/winter-solstice/details
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,A.O. Scott,58,70,"If there is a bit more humor on display here -- some of it evidence that an element of self-conscious self-mockery is sneaking into the franchise -- there is also more violence, and, true to the film’s title, a deeper intimation of darkness. What there isn’t, as usual, is much in the way of good acting, with the decisive and impressive exception of Ms. Stewart, who can carry a close-up about as well as anyone in movies today.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-twilight-saga-eclipse/details
Double Play: James Benning and Richard Linklater,Nicolas Rapold,71,70,"The graceful flow avoids the spoon-feeding of pocket biographies, and even if the material can feel lean at times, Mr. Klinger shepherds along a valuable encounter with a sense of easy, generally uncanned observation.","Jul 17, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/double-play-james-benning-and-richard-linklater/details
The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros,Nathan Lee,70,70,"Directed by Auraeus Solito from a screenplay by Michiko Yamamoto, Maximo has charmed film festival audiences from Sundance to Jerusalem with its refreshingly blasé handling of homosexuality, its amiable actors and its delicacy of milieu.

Hacksaw Ridge,A.O. Scott,71,70,"Desmond Doss was calm, humble and courageous, qualities Mr. Gibson honors but does not share.

India's Daughter,Rachel Saltz,72,70,"India’s Daughter is a portrait of a place and time.

Dracula,Vincent Canby,57,70,"Dracula has the nervy enthusiasm of the work of a precocious film student who has magically acquired a master's command of his craft. It's surprising, entertaining and always just a little too much.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dracula/details
Sweet Home Alabama,Stephen Holden,45,70,"If Sweet Home Alabama, directed by Andy Tennant from a screenplay by C. Jay Cox, has the ingredients for a classic screwball comedy, the movie is in such a rush to entertain that it barely connects the dots of its story. But it still has its effectively goofy comic moments.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sweet-home-alabama/details

Chuck,Glenn Kenny,68,70,"Mr. Schreiber has almost no physical resemblance to Wepner, in his heyday a burly, mustachioed redhead. Mr. Schreiber is a terrific actor, however, and he pulls it off.

Meet Monica Velour,Jeannette Catsoulis,51,70,"This is Ms. Cattrall's movie all the way.

Snow on Tha Bluff,Daniel M.

They Call It Myanmar: Lifting the Curtain,Andy Webster,68,70,"Robert H.

Puccini for Beginners,Stephen Holden,54,70,"It all looks easy when it's carried off this smoothly.

The Mighty Macs,Neil Genzlinger,49,70,"Sometimes a film feels a bit too pat and yet is impossible to resist. The Mighty Macs, based on the national championship run of the 1972 women's basketball team at Immaculata College near Philadelphia, is such a film: lots of button pushing, but in the end you're glad you saw it.","Oct 20, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-mighty-macs/details
Ingrid Bergman in Her Own Words,Manohla Dargis,75,70,"Part of what makes In Her Own Words so pleasurable is that it’s so insistently celebratory, despite the traumas and hurts that trickle in.

My Reincarnation,Daniel M. Gold,63,70,"Especially in the early footage, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu is an engaging, charismatic figure; by the end, Yeshi is finding his own footing, able to relate to a young, wired-in audience.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,Bosley Crowther,96,70,"The ultimate touch of ghoulish humor is when we see the bomb actually going off, dropped on some point in Russia, and a jazzy sound track comes in with a cheerful melodic rendition of ""We'll Meet Again Some Sunny Day.""

The East,A.O. Scott,68,70,"It may be asking too much of The East — which is, after all, a twisty, breathless genre film — to wish that it would frame the contradictions of contemporary capitalism more rigorously. The movie is aware that they exist, and wishes that they could be resolved more or less happily, which is hard to argue with, though also hard to believe.","May 30, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-east/details

The Garden of Earthly Delights,Nathan Lee,74,70,"Affected but elegant, this digital video riff on ""Death in Venice"" was orchestrated by Lech Majewski, the Polish writer, painter and director of films, plays and operas. His musicality is evident in the fresh and lively flow of images, though his tin ear for dialogue and staleness of theme enervates the composition.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-garden-of-earthly-delights/details
Sleepwalk with Me,Stephen Holden,71,70,"These episodes, some staged as surreal dream sequences, inject this otherwise prosaic-looking movie with a visual pizazz that makes Sleepwalk With Me more than just a glorified stand-up act.","Aug 23, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sleepwalk-with-me/details

Bug,Jeannette Catsoulis,62,70,"The escalating hysteria and grisly set pieces of Bug may strain credulity, but Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bug/details
Manos Sucias,Jeannette Catsoulis,65,70,"The light is menacing, the mood watchful and the action scenes have a crude, desperate energy that gets the job done.

Heartbeats,Stephen Holden,70,70,"Monologues delivered by assorted unidentified losers in love who relate their unhappy stories to an unseen listener lend Heartbeats the semblance of a structure.

The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,Ben Kenigsberg,tbd,70,The fates of several of the movie’s bitcoin entrepreneurs are unlikely to send viewers rushing to exchange their dollars.

Night Owls,Stephen Holden,73,70,"The performances are so crackling that you can imagine Ms. Salazar and Mr. Pally, given richer material, becoming a slapstick comedy team: the spitfire and the nerd.","Dec  3, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/night-owls/details
Neshoba,A.O. Scott,71,70,"This film is a document of hope, progress and idealism but also a reminder that the deep springs of bigotry and violence that fed a long, vicious campaign of domestic terrorism have not dried up.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/neshoba/details

Tales from the Golden Age,Stephen Holden,68,70,"The strongest tales embrace a strain of barnyard humor that is matched by the robust performances of actors who convey an earthy jocularity.

The Reunion,David DeWitt,26,70,"The Reunion has no pretensions of originality, and maybe that's just fine.

Land of Mine,A.O.

Mysterious Object at Noon,Elvis Mitchell,69,70,"Mr. Weerasethakul's film is like a piece of chamber music slowly, deftly expanding into a full symphonic movement; to watch it is to enter a fugue state that has the music and rhythms of another culture.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mysterious-object-at-noon/details

Bachelor Party,Janet Maslin,56,70,"It takes much longer than might be expected for Bachelor Party...to degenerate into a mindless mob scene. Until it takes that turn for the worse, the movie is actually funny. That is, it's as funny as ""Police Academy,"" which like this film was written by Neal Israel and Pat Proft. And it's certainly funnier than it has been made to look by its advertising campaign, which seems to feature the usual gang of suspects enjoying the usual sophomoric sex romp.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bachelor-party/details
Con Air,Elvis Mitchell,52,70,"The colorfully written Con Air is a solid chip off ""The Rock,"" pumped up and very well cast, with the prettiness and polish of advertising art.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/con-air/details
A Birder's Guide to Everything,Stephen Holden,61,70,"This gentle comedy, the first feature directed by Rob Meyer, is an eye opener for anyone who takes the everyday natural world for granted.

With God on Our Side: George W.

When Animals Dream,A.O. Scott,54,70,"When Animals Dream is a beguiling parable of cruelty and the resistance to it.

National Lampoon's Vacation,Janet Maslin,60,70,"National Lampoon's Vacation, which is more controlled than other Lampoon movies have been, is careful not to stray too far from its target. The result is a confident humor and throwaway style that helps sustain the laughs - of which there are quite a few.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/vacation/details
Drivers Wanted,David DeWitt,tbd,70,There's an authenticity to Drivers Wanted that seems so true and tough that it overwhelms any standard immigrants-up-from-their-bootstraps theme.,"Nov 30, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/drivers-wanted/details

The Rocket,Manohla Dargis,72,70,"What gives this movie its sting is that, despite Mr. Mordaunt’s insistent attempts at uplift, death hovers over this story at every single moment.","Jan  9, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-rocket/details
Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq,Stephen Holden,76,70,The movie is unusual for its absence of gossip.

Contact,Stephen Holden,62,70,"The movie, adapted from a novel by Carl Sagan, presents one long chain of teasingly open-ended questions about reason versus faith and technology versus religion, and ends up tentatively embracing mysticism over rationality.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/contact/details
Next Year Jerusalem,Daniel M. Gold,51,70,"What elevates the film beyond a video scrapbook, though, are the glimpses of the routines and slow rhythms of the nursing home before and after this adventure.","May 15, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/next-year-jerusalem/details

Psycho,Bosley Crowther,97,70,"The consequence in his denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair. Mr. Perkins and Miss Leigh perform with verve, and Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam do well enough in other roles.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/psycho-1960/details
The Elephant in the Living Room,Jeannette Catsoulis,69,70,"Fair to a fault, ""Elephant"" omits what could be considered crucial voices - like lawmakers, the Humane Society (which helped finance the film) and mental-health professionals - in its attempt to understand those who believe their particular beast is as harmless as a kitten.

A People Uncounted,Andy Webster,72,70,"Much of this movie is composed of survivors who give harrowing accounts of their experiences, and their warnings about rising ethnic hatred in Europe should not be ignored.

The Shine of Day,Nicolas Rapold,64,70,"The Shine of Day pulls itself together with an ending that feels a bit ready-made for drawing out the parallels between its kindred performers.

Mommy,A.O. Scott,74,70,"To take Mommy as an undisciplined outpouring of aggression and angst is to underestimate its artistry. [Mr. Dolan] has both advanced beyond the romanticism of “Heartbeats” and “Laurence Anyways” and regressed toward a more primal and confrontational mode of storytelling. Mommy may seem out of control, but it knows exactly what it’s doing.","Jan 22, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mommy/details
Crimson Gold,Dana Stevens,81,70,"The occasional obviousness of the film's themes is more than balanced by the subtlety of its methods and by the stolid, irreducible individuality of its protagonist, Hussein.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/crimson-gold/details
All Good Things,Manohla Dargis,57,70,"Certainly the fictionalized brood in All Good Things is equal to the Friedmans in terms of dysfunction, and they're loaded.","Dec  6, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-good-things/details

Mysteries of the Jesus Prayer,Andy Webster,tbd,70,"The most consistent and useful thread running throughout this enervating travelogue is the value of silence as a path to inner peace, a notion to which any Manhattan dweller can surely attest.","Apr  7, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mysteries-of-the-jesus-prayer/details
30 Years to Life,Dave Kehr,56,70,"Though 30 Years to Life doesn't break any new ground, it's a light, engaging, well-carpentered film, with a quick wit and a sense of character just deep enough to lend some weight to the laugh lines.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/30-years-to-life/details
The Reception,Lawrence Van Gelder,64,70,"It's an intimate chamber piece, dialogue-heavy and at times claustrophobic, but the four central characters are so deftly sketched, and their shifting alliances so intricately choreographed, that the film never feels talky or staged. The actors are consistently excellent.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-reception/details
Ushpizin,Stephen Holden,70,70,"Stylistically Ushpizin belongs to a classic tradition of raucous Yiddish comedy that is easy to enjoy if taken lightly. At the same time, it sustains a double vision of ultra-Orthodox life.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ushpizin/details
Abendland,Manohla Dargis,67,70,"It's impossible to know from the movie whether Mr. Geyrhalter believes this paradise needs protecting or whether something in his words - irony, fury, laughter - was lost in translation.","Jul 26, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/abendland/details
The Birth of a Nation,A.O. Scott,69,70,"The movie, uneven as it is, has terrific momentum and passages of concentrated visual beauty. The acting is strong even when the script wanders into thickets of rhetoric and mystification. And despite its efforts to simplify and italicize the story, it’s admirably difficult, raising thorny questions about ends and means, justice and mercy, and the legacy of racism that lies at the root of our national identity.","Oct  6, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-birth-of-a-nation/details
The Notebook,A.O. Scott,57,70,"The Notebook is a skillfully made movie, with sequences that may haunt you after you leave the theater.

Anvil! The Story of Anvil,A.O. Scott,82,70,"Mr. Reiner and Mr. Kudlow may not quite merit full-metal glory, but they don't deserve oblivion either, and Anvil! The Story of Anvil makes both a case and a place for their band.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/anvil!-the-story-of-anvil/details
The Painting (Le Tableau),Anita Gates,70,70,"This is a sweet adventure story for children. (Surely, American parents can deal with the bare breasts of one talking painting.)

Snow White and the Huntsman,A.O.

Tale of Tales,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,70,"Strip away the smatterings of sex and globs of gore, and children would really get a kick out of Tale of Tales, Matteo Garrone’s colorful and kinky exploration of what women want.

Farewell,Stephen Holden,74,70,"When it comes to actual historical details, Farewell crams too many notions into expositional blips of dialogue.

Cuba feliz,Stephen Holden,62,70,"In painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people, the movie exalts the Marxian dream of honest working folk, with little to show for their labor, living harmoniously, joined in song.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cuba-feliz/details

The War Tapes,Dana Stevens,77,70,"Whatever your opinion of the war - and however it has changed over the years - this movie is sure to challenge your thinking and disturb your composure. It provides no reassurance, no euphemism, no closure. Given the subject and the circumstances, how could it?",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-war-tapes/details

This Ain't No Mouse Music,Andy Webster,tbd,70,"It’s Arhoolie’s musicians — Big Mama Thornton, Flaco Jiménez, Michael Doucet of the Cajun band BeauSoleil and others — who are the true stars.

Jindabyne,A.O. Scott,65,70,The real flaw is that the movie's best features -- the aching clarity of its central performances -- threaten to be lost in a wilderness of metaphor and mystification.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jindabyne/details
La Soga (The Butcher's Son),Jeannette Catsoulis,51,70,"La Soga moves with a crazed energy that denies moral nuance. But the banal narrative (based on events in Mr. Perez's life) is elbowed aside by Josh Crook's eccentric direction and images that the cinematographer, Zeus Morand, brands with near-poetic intensity.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-butchers-son/details

It's a Wonderful Life,Bosley Crowther,89,70,"Indeed, the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer's point of view, is the sentimentality of it—its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra's nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow they all resemble theatrical attitudes rather than average realities. And Mr. Capra's ""turkey dinners"" philosophy, while emotionally gratifying, doesn't fill the hungry paunch.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/its-a-wonderful-life/details

Mighty Aphrodite,Elvis Mitchell,59,70,"Dependably well made and not quite like any Allen film that came before.

Radio Unnameable,A.O. Scott,72,70,"The charm of Radio Unnameable is, finally, elegiac.

Black Sheep,A.O. Scott,62,70,"Once you have seen a sheep munching on a bloody human leg, you may think twice about your next leg of lamb. On the other hand maybe you'll be inspired to seek vengeance. To provoke one of these responses -- vegetarianism or a defiant meat eating -- may be the point of this odd, amusing film.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-sheep/details

Frontier(s),Manohla Dargis,44,70,"Although at times Mr. Gens veers dangerously close to the unpardonable, with images that evoke the Holocaust too strongly, Frontier(s) finally works because its shivers are as plausible as they are outrageous.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/frontiers/details
Bhutto,Mike Hale,68,70,"If nothing else, the directors, Duane Baughman and Johnny O'Hara, deserve praise for devoting this kind of attention to a foreign leader and to the internal politics of another country (as opposed to how those politics affect the United States).","Dec  6, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bhutto/details
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I,A.O.

Jackie & Ryan,Stephen Holden,55,70,"It uses a terrific score of bluegrass and old-timey songs, many of them written by Nick Hans, to underscore the connection and to evoke a fundamental American spirit epitomized by traveling musicians with banjos, fiddles and guitars.","Jul  2, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jackie-ryan/details

Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,Neil Genzlinger,54,70,"It’s hard to score big laughs with hidden-camera material these days because there has been so much of it since the “Jackass” TV show, but Mr. Knoxville and his young sidekick still land a few jaw-droppers.","Oct 24, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jackass-presents-bad-grandpa/details

Son of Saul,A.O. Scott,89,70,"Mr. Nemes orchestrates a tour de force of suspense, a swift symphony of collisions, coincidences and reversals that is almost unbearably exciting. His skill is undeniable, but also troubling. The movie offers less insight than sensation, an emotional experience that sits too comfortably within the norms of entertainment. This is not entirely the director’s fault. The Holocaust, once forbidden territory, is now safe and familiar ground.","Dec 17, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/son-of-saul/details

It's About You,Stephen Holden,55,70,"Because Kurt Markus's Super 8 camera is the cinematic equivalent of a single microphone, the film's look matches the scratchy quality of its ancient (by rock 'n' roll standards) sound. The crudeness brings out the elemental quality of music that digs deeply into the soil of working-class American life in songs that express the defiance, despair and nobility of people who refuse to go down without a fight.","Jan  3, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/its-about-you/details
Stander,Stephen Holden,62,70,"Loses some its bearings once it turns into a caper movie.

In the Mouth of Madness,Janet Maslin,53,70,"In the Mouth of Madness has enough menace and novelty to please fans of Mr. Carpenter's horror films (among them The Fog, Christine and Halloween) without the wider interest of an enchanting parable like Starman, which he also directed.

Fraulein,Jeannette Catsoulis,64,70,"An intimate, elusive drama about the boundaries of friendship and nationality, Fräulein presents immigrant lives with significantly more empathy than detail.

The Jane Austen Book Club,Stephen Holden,61,70,"Such a well-acted, literate adaptation of Karen Joy Fowler’s 2004 best seller that your impulse is to forgive it for being the formulaic, feel-good chick flick that it is.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-jane-austen-book-club/details

Kill Zone 2,Andy Webster,73,70,"If there’s one rewarding thing about many Hong Kong action directors, it’s that they rarely dawdle in getting to what fight fans have come for: bracing shootouts and high-impact fisticuffs and footwork.","May 12, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kill-zone-2/details

Delicatessen,Janet Maslin,66,70,"Among the things that deserve mention in this lightweight but sometimes subversively stylish farce are its ingenious credit sequence, its lively editing by Herve Schneid, its use of code names like Artichoke Heart and Cordon Bleu in the guerrilla war that rages underground and its reference to a couple of odd inventions.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/delicatessen/details
Why Did I Get Married?,Jeannette Catsoulis,54,70,"More than anything, a Tyler Perry movie is an interactive experience, and Why Did I Get Married? is no exception.

Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train,Stephen Holden,65,70,"Smoothly incorporates archival material, including scenes of Mr. Zinn's public appearances, interviews with Daniel Ellsberg, Noam Chomsky, Daniel Berrigan and Alice Walker (his student at Spelman).

The Kings of Summer,Stephen Holden,61,70,"The best way to enjoy The Kings of Summer is to view it as a likable comic fantasy dreamed up by filmmakers (Chris Galletta wrote the screenplay) who are close enough to adolescence to infuse their ramshackle story with a youthful, carefree whimsy.","May 30, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/toys-house/details

The Last King of Scotland,Manohla Dargis,74,70,"Furiously paced, with excellent performances by Forest Whitaker as Amin and James McAvoy as the foolish Scotsman who becomes the leader's personal physician, the film has texture, if not depth and enough intelligence to almost persuade you that it actually has something of note to say.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-last-king-of-scotland/details

The LEGO Batman Movie,Manohla Dargis,75,70,"As gateway drugs go, The Lego Batman Movie is pretty irresistible. It’s silly without being truly strange or crossing over into absurdity.

American Revolutionary: The Evolution of Grace Lee Boggs,Nicolas Rapold,78,70,"Ms. Lee could have delved more deeply into Ms. Boggs’s thoughts, and slips into glib autopilot by using archival footage with sound effects or repeating ideas of personal transformation.

The Oath,Mike Hale,72,70,"It has staying power. In place of large revelations, you’ll find yourself remembering scenes like the one in which Abu Jandal sits absorbed by a news report of a bombing in Kabul, until his son requests a change of channel.

The Purge: Election Year,A.O. Scott,55,70,"The Purge: Election Year takes itself just seriously enough to provide the expected measure of fun — a blend of aggression, release and relief.

Smiling Through the Apocalypse: Esquire in the 60s,Ben Kenigsberg,65,70,"It’s both a credit to, and a shortcoming of, the movie that it suggests an illustrated bibliography.

We Came Home,Nicole Herrington,tbd,70,"Ariana Delawari documents her father’s role in helping his home country, Afghanistan, modernize its financial system after the fall of the Taliban.

You Don't Mess with the Zohan,A.O. Scott,54,70,"Brazenly self-confident in its refusal to pander to the imagined sensitivity of its audience.

Deadpool,Manohla Dargis,65,70,"It’s no surprise that the teams hired to bring a property like Deadpool to the screen know how to keep the machine oiled and humming; it’s the ones who somehow manage to temporarily stick a wrench in the works, adding something human — a feeling instead of another quip — who are worth your attention.","Feb 11, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/deadpool/details

Breathing,Nicolas Rapold,66,70,"As a collaboration Breathing owes much to the balanced compositions, lucid imagery and judicious use of color executed by Mr. Gschlacht, who brought a similarly clear gaze to morally fraught work by other Austrian directors (Götz Spielmann's ""Revanche,"" Jessica Hausner's ""Lourdes,"" Michael Glawogger's ""Slumming"").","Aug 30, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/breathing/details
Heneral Luna,Ken Jaworowski,58,70,"I’m only a little embarrassed at liking Heneral Luna, an audaciously manipulative movie that’s more involving than it should be.

The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate,Mike Hale,57,70,"Surprisingly old-fashioned.

Dolphin Tale,Neil Genzlinger,64,70,"Pitched awfully young, without a shred of the satire or subtlety that is generally found in films aimed at tweeners and above.

Closing Escrow,Laura Kern,58,70,"Even naysayers of reality TV’s simplistic structure, which the film openly borrows, may find themselves rooting for a couple of choice -- and having fun in the process. The real-estate game can actually be a laughing matter when you’re not a contestant.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/closing-escrow/details

Love and Other Drugs,A.O. Scott,55,70,"A sometimes intoxicating, sometimes headache-inducing cocktail: a sweet, libidinous love story; a candid comedy of bedroom and workplace manners; and, most bravely, if also most jarringly, a medical melodrama involving a chronic and very serious disease.","Dec 13, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-and-other-drugs/details

Paul Taylor: Creative Domain,Rachel Saltz,tbd,70,"Through it all, Mr. Taylor’s creative mysteries remain intact; a master of the casual and the vernacular (a good way to learn about movement, he says, is to watch football halftime shows), he nonetheless approaches the mystical.","Sep 10, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/paul-taylor-creative-domain/details

Limelight,Jeannette Catsoulis,57,70,"As a trippy, trifling memorial to a time before its eponymous club was a mini-mall and rave culture a woozy memory, Limelight delivers the messed-up goods.","Sep 22, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/limelight/details

For the Bible Tells Me So,,73,70,"There is no denying that the film, however inelegant, fills a need.

The September Issue,Manohla Dargis,69,70,"This entertaining, glib movie is about the maintenance of a brand that Ms. Wintour has brilliantly cultivated since she assumed her place at the top of the editorial masthead in 1988 and which the documentary’s director, R.

Bill W.,Nicolas Rapold,69,70,"Names and events are ticked off in rapid succession, and the big, and fascinating, question of what role spirituality played receives cautious attention at best.

Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,A.O. Scott,53,70,"The satire may be a little too gentle, but there is something disarmingly tender about the way Mr. Lee dramatizes young Billy’s predicament.

Little Man Tate,Vincent Canby,71,70,"As directed by Ms. Foster, the film has a kind of purity of purpose and control that is very rare in mass-market movies. It avoids a lot of sentimental nonsense.

The Possession,Jeannette Catsoulis,45,70,"Even if you resist the film's claims of being based on one family's actual experiences, The Possession is eerily enjoyable pulp. Perched somewhere between ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" - and with a dash of ""The Unborn"" - the story benefits from an unusually restrained sound design and special effects that enhance but never obliterate its troubled-family center.","Aug 30, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/untitled-sam-raimi-horror-project/details

United 93,Manohla Dargis,90,70,"Its focus is purposely narrow.

The Names of Love,Stephen Holden,62,70,"For all the potentially dangerous subjects it glosses, above all the tangled legacies of the Holocaust and the Algerian war, The Names of Love dances away from any uncomfortable provocation.

Fracture,Manohla Dargis,68,70,"The screenwriters, Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers, hit the customary thriller notes with a touch of humor, and the director, Gregory Hoblit (who worked similar terrain in ""Primal Fear""), arranges those notes into a catchy, insistent rhythm.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fracture/details
The Quick and the Dead,Janet Maslin,49,70,"Ms. Stone's presence nicely underscores the genre-bending tactics of Sam Raimi, the cult director now doing his best to reinvent the B-movie in a spirit of self-referential glee.

Night Across the Street,A.O. Scott,76,70,"Unlike his precursors Georges Franju and Luis Buñuel, who reveled in the shock of incongruity, Mr. Ruiz took it in stride.

Hero,Manohla Dargis,85,70,"Filled with meticulous set pieces, including a showdown between Snow and Moon set among swirls of golden-yellow leaves, Hero is easy on the eyes, but it's too segmented to gather much momentum and too art-directed to convey much urgency.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hero/details

Dinosaur 13,Jeannette Catsoulis,66,70,"Dinosaur 13 may not be the best documentary, but as a scientific soap opera, it’s a doozy.","Aug 14, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dinosaur-13/details

Winter Nomads,Nicolas Rapold,77,70,"What little we learn of Pascal, who has worked in Switzerland as a shepherd for more than 30 years, and Carole, who is a former dietitian, fits in a scene or two, but their practical journey yields a certain contemplative equanimity.","Sep 26, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/winter-nomads/details
Radiant City,,60,70,"The cinematographer Patrick McLaughlin's eerie, sometimes monumental images italicize the experts' statements, making the suburbs seem like an asphalt-and-Sheetrock dreamscape where democracy goes to die.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/radiant-city/details
My Sex Life... or How I Got Into an Argument,Janet Maslin,76,70,"Both Paul and the film would seem maddening if they weren't so passionately sincere, and if Paul did not gaze at the film's many beautiful young actresses with such an amazed, seductive gleam in his eye.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/my-sex-life-or-how-i-got-into-an-argument/details
Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back,Ken Jaworowski,70,70,"The art is the star and Ms. Axelrod features plenty of it.

Cropsey,Jeannette Catsoulis,73,70,"Its straggling, true-crime narrative, leaping hither and yon like a dog chasing butterflies, is not what holds the film together; the real glue is the emergence of a parallel between location and suspect, between literal dumping ground and figurative. This is so effective that there was no need for the directors to conduct a handheld, ""Blair Witch""-y foray into the nighttime woods -- their film is creepy enough in broad daylight.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cropsey/details
The Crow,Caryn James,71,70,"It is a dark, lurid revenge fantasy and not the breakthrough, star-making movie some people have claimed. But it is a genre film of a high order, stylish and smooth.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-crow/details
The Only Real Game,Neil Genzlinger,69,70,"The history lesson is fascinating, and it’s nice to see an American export other than a Hollywood blockbuster engendering good will.","Jun  5, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-only-real-game/details

Broken English,,61,70,"A well-acted, smartly directed film that’s depressing because it could have amounted to so much more. It departs from the studio-financed romantic-comedy template in just one, unfortunately fatal respect: it makes a point of pride out of rejecting cliché, then swoons into its embrace.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/broken-english/details
The Youth,Dave Kehr,63,70,"Mr. Ratnam is a dynamic, natural filmmaker who happily uses every device at his disposal, from rapid-fire MTV editing to sped-up action scenes that recall silent serials, to keep his lengthy film moving at a brisk pace.

Master of the Universe,Nicolas Rapold,72,70,"Mr. Voss’s metaphors pile up helplessly: Finance is like being in the army, like catching a virus and as hard to grasp as quantum particles.

Mr. X,Nicolas Rapold,67,70,"Though Ms. Louise-Salomé’s film strikes a potentially irritating pose as a kind of artistic séance — shrouding interviewees in shadow, conjuring up clips with the drifting rhythm of the unconscious — it delivers articulate insights and has an elegant construction.","Aug 14, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mr-x/details
Pawn Sacrifice,Neil Genzlinger,65,70,"Ultimately, it is only partly about Bobby Fischer. It is equally about us — Americans or any other nationality inclined to put too much importance on chess matches, soccer matches, space races, whatever.

The Debt,A.O. Scott,65,70,"As The Debt grows more complex and suspenseful, it also becomes more literal, losing some of its dramatic intensity.","Aug 30, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-debt/details
Time to Leave,Dana Stevens,67,70,"Time to Leave subordinates narrative to mood.

A Cantor's Tale,,70,70,"The movie is most engaging when following Mr. Mendelson around his old neighborhood, Borough Park, which, we learn, is simply teeming with bakers whose singing is on a par with their knishes.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-cantors-tale/details
The Divine Order,Ben Kenigsberg,69,70,"The Divine Order effectively illustrates how peer pressure can influence the political process. Collective silence, whether it’s from women unwilling to publicly press for their rights or men afraid to voice agreement with their wives for fear of looking weak around co-workers, proves more of an obstacle than any opponent.

Seven Psychopaths,Manohla Dargis,66,70,"Meta to the max, filled with clever jokes and observations that stick like barbs and deflated ones that land with a thud, Seven Psychopaths is a leisurely riff about movies, violence, storytelling and the art of the steal.","Oct 11, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/seven-psychopaths/details
Joy,A.O. Scott,56,70,"The movie, in all its mess and glory, belongs almost entirely to Ms. Lawrence. She is the kind of movie star who turns everyone else into a character actor.

How She Move,,63,70,"There’s nary a twist you don’t see coming. But the film’s strong acting, spectacular dance routines and culturally specific details turn clichés into catharsis.

Felon,Stephen Holden,58,70,"Mr. Dorff’s hot-wired portrayal of a prisoner under physical and psychic siege gives Felon its emotional through line as Wade’s attitude metamorphoses from stunned disbelief, to terror, to despair, to fury and finally to hope.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/felon/details
Earth,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,70,"This is nature defanged and declawed for kiddie consumption, so the emphasis is on awwww-filled moments.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/earth/details
About Last Night,A.O. Scott,62,70,"Many of the funniest parts seem to arise spontaneously from Mr. Hart’s uncensored brain and fast-moving mouth.

Dormant Beauty,A.O. Scott,72,70,"If Dormant Beauty does not rank among Mr. Bellocchio’s best movies, it nonetheless still occasionally shows him at his best.

Wild Tigers I Have Known,Stephen Holden,52,70,"Like ""Twelve and Holding,"" another film from last year's New Directors series, Wild Tigers achingly sympathizes with the desperate lengths an obsessed adolescent will go to in pursuit of love.

Assisted Living,Stephen Holden,57,70,"May be a comedy, but its images of physical frailty are inescapably unsettling.

...And They Lived Happily Ever After,Stephen Holden,58,70,"Nobody does adultery in movies with more style and zest than the French, especially when the mode is frivolous.

The Sea,Stephen Holden,52,70,"The film's flamboyant portrayals of characters you love to hate have a malicious comic edge. If ever there were a movie to gladden the hearts of misanthropes, this is it.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-sea/details
Deadfall,Manohla Dargis,52,70,"A diverting neo-noir, Deadfall brings to mind those dark, old-fashioned entertainments in rotation on Turner Classic Movies that suck you in with their genre machinery, sullen beauties and despair.","Dec  6, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/deadfall/details

Life of Crime,Ben Kenigsberg,60,70,"As a late-summer caper movie, it hits the spot. The film offers the intriguing contrast of actors and a director (Daniel Schechter) taking a different approach to known material.","Aug 28, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-of-crime/details
The Work,Jeannette Catsoulis,84,70,"Opening an aperture into a process so ego-stripping that it feels unseemly to witness, The Work is enlightening yet also punishing.","Oct 26, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-work/details
Northern Soul,Jeannette Catsoulis,64,70,"Funny and feisty, gritty and sometimes grim, this first feature from the photographer Elaine Constantine delivers a sweaty snapshot of a very specific time and place.","Oct  1, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/northern-soul/details
McCullin,Ben Kenigsberg,74,70,"McCullin is not a groundbreaking documentary, but it wears its conventional format well, taking its cues (and its power) from the photographs themselves.","Oct 29, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mccullin/details

Only the Young,Manohla Dargis,71,70,"If Mr. Tippet and Ms. Mims weren't such accomplished visual stylists, you might even think that the teenagers shot the documentary themselves, which explains both its appeal and its limitations.","Dec  6, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/only-the-young/details
Fighting,A.O.

Batman Returns,Janet Maslin,68,70,"Mr. Burton's new Batman Returns is as sprightly as its predecessor was sluggish, and it succeeds in banishing much of the dourness and tedium that made the first film such an ordeal.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/batman-returns/details

Loves Her Gun,Jeannette Catsoulis,51,70,"Adopting an appealingly low-key approach to a high-stakes subject, this gently observant drama from Geoff Marslett takes its sweet time introducing the girl to the gun, but when it does, we’re all but guaranteed to care.","Jan  9, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/loves-her-gun/details

The Lunchbox,A.O. Scott,76,70,"The comedy is more wry than uproarious, the melodrama gently poignant rather than operatic, and the sentimentality just sweet enough to be satisfying rather than bothersome.","Feb 27, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lunchbox/details
Facing the Music,Stephen Holden,77,70,"Often feels like two movies loosely sewn together.

Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story,Lawrence Van Gelder,54,70,"The story is told in faux-documentary style, echoing the films of Christopher Guest, and if the cast never quite matches Mr. Guest's ensemble in comic inventiveness, they nonetheless manage to invest a very slight story line with a loose, scruffy charm.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blackballed-the-bobby-dukes-story/details
Copycat,Janet Maslin,54,70,"The screenplay for Copycat, by Ann Biderman and Jay Presson Allen from a story by David Madsen, is otherwise so crackling good that character development threatens to eclipse the actual crimes.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/copycat/details
Mean Dreams,Andy Webster,64,70,"Nathan Morlando’s Mean Dreams may use a time-honored premise — young lovers on the lam (see: “Badlands”) — but it does so with such quiet, gently appealing assurance that it makes the template seem fresh again.","Mar 16, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mean-dreams/details

Videocracy,Manohla Dargis,60,70,"Given the stakes, it’s hard not to wish that Mr. Gandini had been more ambitious: at 85 minutes, Videocracy can only scratch the surface.

Fame,,58,70,"Apart from its virtues or defects as a general feature film, Fame - in its attitude toward the performing arts - strikes a new note. It is a streetwise film with streetwise characters. In its deflating moral for every protagonist, it sees these arts as meshed into a smog of urban existence. Its novelty is its anti-Romantic, ironic view toward these callings.

Smash & Grab: The Story of the Pink Panthers,Nicolas Rapold,66,70,"Smash and Grab has a grating, repetitive score and can look a little homely on the big screen.

The Lookout,,73,70,"Mr. Frank’s screenplay for The Lookout was long considered one of Hollywood's great unproduced scripts.

Five Nights in Maine,Neil Genzlinger,45,70,"Maris Curran had plenty of opportunities to insert a cheesy plot twist into “Five Nights in Maine,” her delicate drama about loss and its aftermath.

There is only vivid evidence of a society that, despite limp efforts at discouraging domestic abuse, remains mired in ancient patriarchy, sanctioning polygamy and, implicitly, often attendant violence.","Oct 30, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bitter-honey/details

Living Out Loud,Elvis Mitchell,64,70,The filmmaker has borrowed from Chekhov the soul-baring introspection that can be so ineffable on the page or stage yet becomes so damply sensitive and dramatically vague on screen.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/living-out-loud/details
We Live in Public,Manohla Dargis,69,70,"From the ample evidence, Mr. Harris’s own life in public was a bust. Ms. Timoner sees him as a cautionary tale as well as a visionary.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/we-live-in-public/details

Becoming Bond,Glenn Kenny,65,70,"On the whole, Becoming Bond is sufficiently winning that you might even forgive its chapter titles, each one a worse-than-the-previous play on a James Bond-associated phrase","Jul 20, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/becoming-bond/details
Ithaca,Neil Genzlinger,36,70,"Ms. Ryan’s muted approach may be what we’ve come to expect of looks back at this period — nostalgia always comes with a lot of browns and grays, and with plenty of voice-over (in this case, Marcus’s letters to Homer). But she executes the formula well.","Sep  8, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ithaca/details
"Crazy, Stupid, Love",A.O. Scott,68,70,"The movie, true to its own PG-13 rating, opts for mildness, modesty and chastened optimism. At the same time, though, it seems to know that a crueler, more cynical rendering of its story - a ""Bitter, Hopeless, Love"" - lurks between the lines.","Jul 28, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/crazy-stupid-love/details

Steve Jobs: Man in the Machine,Nicolas Rapold,72,70,"If this isn’t the iPhone of documentaries, it gets its point across, and unlike Mr. Gibney’s Scientology exposé “Going Clear,” this movie has a harder target (albeit with its own devoted following).","Sep  3, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/steve-jobs-man-in-the-machine/details

The Drop,A.O. Scott,69,70,"Mr. Roskam’s direction is gratifyingly loose.

Horses of God,Stephen Holden,76,70,"In its demystification of these youthful slum dwellers, the film makes their embrace of terrorism frighteningly comprehensible.

"Massoud, the Afghan",Dana Stevens,60,70,"I was struck by how personal this movie is, and by the delicate symbiosis that develops between biographer and subject.

A Coffee In Berlin,Rachel Saltz,63,70,"If A Coffee in Berlin has its own kind of formula and a romanticism that reads as both youthful and obscuring, it nevertheless absorbs you and makes you wonder what Mr. Gerster will do next.","Jun 12, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/oh-boy/details
Klown,Neil Genzlinger,62,70,"The film, directed by Mikkel Norgaard, somehow manages the difficult trick of going into taboo territory without ever feeling dirty.

Ed Wood,Elvis Mitchell,70,70,"If Ed Wood has a major failing, it's the lack of momentum.  Wood's career had nowhere to go, and to some extent the film has the same problem.  [23 September 1994, p.C34]",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ed-wood/details

The Intervention,Andy Webster,57,70,"Despite her script’s omissions...Ms. DuVall juggles the emotional dynamics with fluid editing and light comic touches. The skilled cast members must flesh out their characters, and the unselfconscious Ms. Lynskey, who invites the audience’s mockery and ends up with its sympathy, is the revelation.","Aug 25, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-intervention/details

Alan Partridge,A.O.

Neighbors,A.O. Scott,68,70,"Neighbors is not a great film and does not really aspire to be. It is more a status report on mainstream American movie comedy, operating in a sweet spot between the friendly and the nasty, and not straining to be daring, obnoxious or even especially original. It knows how to have fun. How very grown-up.","May  8, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/townies/details
Mr. Donkey,Andy Webster,tbd,70,"Zhou Shen and Liu Lu’s bleak farce Mr. Donkey, adapted from their play, has a sentimental streak, and, as farce can, a tendency to overheat.

Red Obsession,Nicole Herrington,68,70,"Red Obsession, a little too stuffed for its nearly 80 minutes, may already be dated, since China’s wine fever has cooled recently.

Taking Woodstock,Stephen Holden,55,70,"This likable, humane movie is not an attempt to recreate the epochal Woodstock Music and Art Fair captured in Michael Wadleigh’s documentary “Woodstock.” It is essentially a small, intimate film into which is fitted a peripheral view of the landmark event.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/taking-woodstock/details
William S. Burroughs: A Man Within,Stephen Holden,63,70,"It is all either blood-chilling or hilarious. For those who celebrate Burroughs as one of the darkest and greatest of all comic artists, he is an extreme social satirist of Swiftian stature, whose quasi-pornographic images offer a stark, ghastly/funny photonegative image of the American body politic.","Nov 16, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/william-s-burroughs-a-man-within/details

La Sapienza,A.O. Scott,74,70,"The movie is an unapologetically rarefied undertaking and at the same time a gracious and inviting film.

The Guard,Manohla Dargis,78,70,"There's a story, in case you're looking for one, though it's almost an afterthought, just the thin glue holding everything together, including the fine cast, the sense of broody place and the fatalism that seems to come with it.

The Forgotten Space,A.O. Scott,54,70,"Unabashedly polemical and rigorously pessimistic, a sustained Marxian indictment of 21st-century capital. The narration, by Mr. Sekula, is at times lyrical and rarely subtle, but the film is most graceful and moving when its argument slows down or wanders into an interesting tangent.","Feb 16, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-forgotten-space/details

Growing Up and Other Lies,Stephen Holden,39,70,"Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Grodsky have an extraordinary ear for the rhythms and nuances of everyday speech, as voices overlap, conversations take random directions, and casual remarks carry loaded subtexts.","Mar 20, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/growing-up-and-other-lies/details
The Retrieval,Manohla Dargis,75,70,"Mr. Eska’s choices are thoughtful if sometimes studied: the movie is well cast with solid performers, and if the handsome digital images look overly sharp, as if outlined in razor, he consistently makes the most of his limited resources.","Apr  1, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-retrieval/details
The Deserted Station,Stephen Holden,75,70,"If repetition has stripped Iran's post-revolutionary cinema of some of its modish luster, The Deserted Station is still a valuable addition to a literature whose characteristics are now internationally well-established.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-deserted-station/details
Dr. No,Bosley Crowther,78,70,"This lively, amusing picture is not to be taken seriously as realistic fiction or even art, any more than the works of Mr. Fleming are to be taken as long-hair literature. It is strictly a tinseled action-thriller, spiked with a mystery of a sort.

"Close, Closed, Closure",Dave Kehr,61,70,"The freer and more sophisticated approach of ""Divine Intervention"" makes these traditional-minded documentaries look somewhat stodgy and old-fashioned by comparison, but both have a value as reportage that Mr. Suleiman's film does not pretend to have.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/close-closed-closure/details

Middle Men,A.O. Scott,60,70,"Originally intended as a cable television series, Middle Men bears some telltale scars of hasty, clumsy truncation.

The Lucky Ones,Laura Kern,53,70,"Because the lead actors work so well together, adding depth and levels of vulnerability to fairly underwritten roles, the emotional consequences of the sense of displacement these ""lucky"" characters -- lucky to be alive, lucky to have met one another -- must deal with always ring true.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lucky-ones/details

Sleeping Dogs Lie,Stephen Holden,63,70,"Sleeping Dogs Lie doesn't pretend to be more than it is: a blunt, provocative comedy sketch whose visual look is almost as bare as that of an episode of the underappreciated Home Box Office series ""Lucky Louie.""

Cellular,Dana Stevens,60,70,"It's an honest, unpretentious, well-made B picture with a clever, silly premise, a handful of sly, unassuming performances and enough car chases, decent jokes and swervy plot complications to make the price of the ticket seem like a decent bargain.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cellular/details
Lourdes,Manohla Dargis,71,70,"One of the pleasures of this intelligent, rigorously thoughtful, somewhat sly film is that it takes place in the space between the inexplicable (no explanation is possible) and the unexplained (enlightenment might be around the corner).",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lourdes/details

Voices in Wartime,Anita Gates,65,70,"Rick King's stirring documentary Voices in Wartime is not, as you might guess from the title, a compilation of soldiers' battlefield letters to their families back home.

Adult World,Stephen Holden,61,70,"Mr. Cusack’s sardonic, understated portrayal of Rat, who is not quite what he says he is, grounds the movie in a wistfully cynical realism.","Feb 13, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/adult-world/details

Spider-Man: Homecoming,Manohla Dargis,73,70,"The Vulture is a mess of prickly contradictions, only some of which seem intentional. His criminality, rage and perhaps his madness have been stoked by class resentment and Mr. Keaton, with his white-hot menace and narrowing eyes, makes him a memorably angry man, not a caricature.","Jun 29, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/spider-man-homecoming/details

Saint of 9/11,Stephen Holden,67,70,"The movie's steadily elegiac tone precludes it from creating a more lively, idiosyncratic portrait of a man who, by many accounts, was a wonderful raconteur whose gift of gab was complemented by a rollicking sense of humor.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/saint-of-911/details
Paul Goodman Changed My Life,A.O. Scott,68,70,"I suspect that he would have approved of Mr. Lee's film, and not only because it approves so unreservedly of him.

Censored Voices,Daniel M.

Down with Love,Dana Stevens,52,70,"Works hard to earn it and is, for the most part, intelligent and amusing, even if it never achieves the full-tilt zany desperation of Delbert Mann's ""Lover Come Back,"" the best of the real Hudson-Day movies.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/down-with-love/details

Chinatown,Vincent Canby,86,70,"Mr. Polanski and Mr. Towne attempted nothing so witty and entertaining, being content instead to make a competently stylish, more or less thirites-ish movie that continually made me wish I were back seeing ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep.""

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,A.O. Scott,63,70,"The dazzling, high-flying silliness is quite an achievement.

Martin,Anita Gates,68,70,"In this splattery George A. Romero movie from 1977, the title character is not your typical vampire. In fact, he may not be a vampire at all. I mean, did Count Dracula ever need hypodermic needles (for sedation) or razor blades?

A Tale of Love and Darkness,A.O. Scott,55,70,"There are many lovely and memorable moments in this film, which is in every way the opposite of a vanity project.

When the Sea Rises,Stephen Holden,62,70,"And as you watch her (Moreau) sink into this semiautobiographical role (she was herself a touring performer in the 1980's), the character emerges as a deep, multilayered woman: kind, gentle and happily partaking of life's simple pleasures much of the time, but when necessary, as tough as her stage character through whom she relishes expressing her residual anger at life's hardships and disappointments.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/when-the-sea-rises/details
Jimi: All Is by My Side,Manohla Dargis,66,70,"Mr. Ridley’s ambitions and refusal to treat Hendrix as a solvable mystery are welcome, given how often biopics re-embalm their subjects.

Snowtime!,Neil Genzlinger,52,70,"It is aimed at younger children and includes pretty songs, but it doesn’t soft-pedal anything.

Benny & Joon,Janet Maslin,57,70,"Benny and Joon is a dangerously fanciful story of cute eccentrics, characters whose quirks are the very essence of their appeal.

Nice Dreams,Janet Maslin,54,70,"If marijuana has a way of heightening the hilarious aspects of things that might not otherwise be funny, then this is very much a marijuana movie.

Diamond Tongues,Ben Kenigsberg,75,70,"The prickly tone is a difficult balancing act, and Diamond Tongues may settle for being a softer-hearted film than its most cynical scenes portend.

Speak the Music: Robert Mann and the Mysteries of Chamber Music,Neil Genzlinger,tbd,70,"Though colleagues and former students chime in, Mr. Miller lets Mr. Mann and his violin do most of the talking, drawing on assorted interviews and vintage performance clips that convey both the skill and the enthusiasm underpinning his subject’s long career.","May  1, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/speak-the-music-robert-mann-and-the-mysteries-of-chamber-music/details

Slither,Manohla Dargis,69,70,"While Slither sometimes feels like a monster-mash, what makes it work is how nimbly it slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/slither/details

Addams Family Values,Janet Maslin,62,70,"Mr. Sonnenfeld repeats some of the first film's favorite visual stunts without wearing out their welcome, and he sustains much more exuberance than a sequel might be expected to have.

Don't Worry Baby,Andy Webster,55,70,"Despite an implausible ending devoid of consequence, “Don’t Worry Baby” benefits from tidy editing, cinematography and, most of all, the presence of the seasoned Mr. McDonald and Ms. Balsam.

A Taxi Driver,Andy Webster,69,70,"The film climaxes with a breathless escape from Gwangju, as Kim and Hinzpeter elude government vehicles with the aid of other cabdrivers.

Celeste and Jesse Forever,Manohla Dargis,59,70,"While Celeste and Jesse is decidedly conventional in most respects, it's pretty swell as an exploration of a relationship between a man and a woman that's no longer predicated by mutual desire.","Aug  2, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/celeste-and-jesse-forever/details

Vision: From the Life of Hildegard Von Bingen,Stephen Holden,68,70,Vision offers a hard-headed view of 12th-century religiosity in which church politics and money conflict with the characters' asceticism.

The Other Man: F.W. de Klerk and the End of Apartheid,Jeannette Catsoulis,62,70,"None of this is particularly cinematic (he relies much too heavily on title cards to fill in historical blanks), but it is engaging, mainly because the stakes were so high and the statesmanship so delicate.","Feb  5, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-other-man-fw-de-klerk-and-the-end-of-apartheid/details

Travelers and Magicians,Dave Kehr,71,70,"As he did in ""The Cup,"" Mr. Norbu provides a lot of ingratiating comic moments.

Parker,A.O. Scott,42,70,"Parker...is not a great movie....But Parker is nonetheless great fun.

There's No One Like You,Laura Kern,68,70,"Krrish is overlong, schmaltzy, wholly derivative and sprinkled with underwhelming song-and-dance numbers.

Company Town,Ben Kenigsberg,tbd,70,"The documentary Company Town, by Natalie Kottke-Masocco and Erica Sardarian, feels fueled by pure desperation; even the rudimentary qualities of the filmmaking (cheap-looking camera work, poorly punctuated title cards) somehow add to its urgency, as if the movie needed to get its message out by any means necessary.","Sep  7, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/company-town/details

The Great Fallacy,Miriam Bale,tbd,70,"Watching it feels like packing a semester-long history course with a very cool, left-leaning teacher into less than 90 minutes.

X-Men: Days of Future Past,A.O.

The Island,Dana Stevens,50,70,"Glossy, witty eye candy with some moderately chewy stuff in the middle.

How to Train Your Dragon 2,Stephen Holden,76,70,"Dragon 2 is considerably darker and more self-aware than its forerunner. Both films are speedier than the average animated blockbuster.

Fonzy,Andy Webster,55,70,"What distinguishes Fonzy is its attention to Diego’s Galician roots.

The Challenge,A.O.

Can't Hardly Wait,Elvis Mitchell,52,70,"[The writers/directors] show easygoing humor and the wisdom to borrow well.

Silent Souls,Jeannette Catsoulis,76,70,"Silent Souls is part folk tale, part lesson in letting go. In its quiet acceptance of the passing of time, this unusual film reminds us that to die is not always the same as to disappear.","Sep 15, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-souls/details
A Late Quartet,Stephen Holden,67,70,"It would be shortsighted to dismiss this deeply felt, musically savvy film, set in a refined cultural precinct of Manhattan, as sudsy melodrama.","Nov  1, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-late-quartet/details

The Five-Year Engagement,A.O. Scott,62,70,"The Five-Year Engagement dutifully hits the marks of its genre, but it is also about the unpredictability of life and the everyday challenges of love.

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,Manohla Dargis,75,70,"Sleek and bloated, specific and generic, “Rogue Nation” is pretty much like most of the “Impossible” movies in that it’s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie, after tinkering and oiling, has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns, global trotting and gadgets, a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star.","Jul 30, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mission-impossible-5/details

Syndromes and a Century,A.O. Scott,71,70,"Syndromes and a Century, like its curious title, has the logic of a dream, a piece of music or perhaps a John Ashbery poem.

Mister Lonely,A.O. Scott,53,70,"Mister Lonely, self-enclosed though it may be, nonetheless demonstrates that Mr. Korine, who showed his ability to shock and repel in earlier films, also has the power to touch, to unsettle and to charm.

Cold in July,Stephen Holden,73,70,"As the movie’s resident live wire, Mr. Johnson, obviously having the time of his life, is a hoot, and the feisty camaraderie among these three men gives Cold in July a euphoric goofiness.","May 22, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cold-in-july/details

The Matchmaker,Nicolas Rapold,69,70,"The efficient approach and tendency toward broad strokes prevent the movie from taking a deep hold, and Mr. Shafir is a hesitant young actor to have at the center.

The Forbidden Room,Stephen Holden,83,70,"On one viewing, at least, it is a typically impenetrable Maddin film: zany one minute, pompous the next.

The Red Turtle,A.O. Scott,86,70,"The Red Turtle practices a minor, gentle magic.

Albert Nobbs,A.O. Scott,57,70,"Ms. McTeer's sly, exuberant performance is a pure delight, and the counterpoint between her physical expressiveness and Ms. Close's tightly coiled reserve is a marvel to behold.

The Sunshine Makers,Manohla Dargis,68,70,"Whether together or apart, Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully seemed to be operating on a similar wavelength, and the movie gets a lot of mileage from their sometimes excellent, at times hair-raising, occasionally puckishly funny and altogether wild adventures.","Jan 19, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-sunshine-makers/details
Scary Movie 3,Stephen Holden,49,70,"The franchise, which had begun to run out of steam in Part 2, has been given a shot of adrenaline with the replacement of the Wayans Brothers as the prime creative forces by Hollywood's original spoof-meister, David Zucker.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/scary-movie-3/details

Broken City,Manohla Dargis,49,70,"Hughes visual choices can feel borrowed and clichéd, but his regard for beauty often compensates for his blunders, as does the sturdy, reliable appeal of another story of good and evil, men and women, light and dark, glass and steel, sex and power.

The Other City,Andy Webster,70,70,"The film's most vivid presence is seen but barely able to speak: Jimmy, a gay man in his 30s dying at Joseph's House, an AIDS hospice.

Night and the City,Janet Maslin,61,70,"As directed by Irwin Winkler, Night and the City is colorfully acted and refreshingly free of all the moody cliches such a story might be expected to thrive on.

The Rolling Stones Olé Olé Olé!: A Trip Across Latin America,Daniel M.

Gangs of Wasseypur,Ben Kenigsberg,89,70,"Although the narrative contains echoes of “The Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II” — and perhaps “Casino,” in that much of it is structured as a flashback from an assassination attempt — “Gangs” lacks the poetry and character interest of those films.","Jan 15, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gangs-of-wasseypur/details

Sicko,A.O. Scott,74,70,"Sicko is the least controversial and most broadly appealing of Mr. Moore’s movies. (It is also, perhaps improbably, the funniest and the most tightly edited.)

Where Soldiers Come From,Jeannette Catsoulis,58,70,"Where Soldiers Come From is, more than anything, a commentary on class.

Comedy of Power,A.O. Scott,64,70,"As ever, Mr. Chabrol’s style is delicate and precise. Comedy of Power is not his deepest or most ambitious film, and its stance of knowing resignation in the face of corruption can feel a little glib.

Butterfly Kiss,Stephen Holden,61,70,"Where most movies portraying sociopathic behavior make some attempt at psychological explanation, Butterfly Kiss offers no background to Eunice's craziness.

It's All So Quiet,Nicolas Rapold,72,70,"Ms. Leopold’s previous film, “Brownian Movement,” was a stringent, even off-putting study of a delicate-looking doctor who has secret trysts with various men, and her latest feature feels gentler, shot digitally and suffused with the gray shadows of old houses and dim twilights.

Suspicion,Bosley Crowther,83,70,"One must remark that the ending is not up to Mr. Hitchcock's usual style, and the general atmosphere of the picture is far less genuine than he previously has wrought.

The Back of the World,Dave Kehr,72,70,"Each of these stories is terribly sad and terribly moving in its own right.

Songs My Brothers Taught Me,Stephen Holden,63,70,"You come at the story, such as it is, as a visitor from the outside world, picking up information as the movie goes along.

Come Undone,Stephen Holden,61,70,"Like Mr. Soldini's last film, ""Days and Clouds,"" a calm, very sad examination of the effects of a husband's sudden job loss on an affluent couple's relationship and social life, Come Undone is solidly grounded in mundane reality.

Caesar Must Die,Manohla Dargis,77,70,"There’s an elemental, almost primitive quality to the Tavianis’ condensing that, at its most effective, dovetails with the prison’s severely circumscribed material reality, as if the high walls, barred windows and suffocating rooms were manifestations of the characters’ states of mind.","Feb  6, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/caesar-must-die/details

When I Saw You,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,70,"When I Saw You is a soft-centered child’s-eye view of alienation, toughened by fine acting (Saleh Bakri shines as a fighter drawn to Ghaydaa) and Hélène Louvart’s full-bodied photography.","Jan 16, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/when-i-saw-you/details
Distant,A.O. Scott,84,70,"Such an accurate depiction of cramped spirits, small-mindedness and men unable to make changes in their lives takes its toll. Distant feels as if it's going nowhere in no particular hurry, and finally leaves us distant from its characters.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/distant/details

Hideaway (Le refuge),Manohla Dargis,61,70,"But while the Pietà imagery startles, it makes increasing sense as the story builds around it. Because as Hideaway deepens and evolves, you understand that the image of Mousse cradling Louis is a manifestation of her love: this was how she held him, with a tender love that in its depth was itself holy.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hideaway-le-refuge/details

The Devil Wears Prada,Dana Stevens,62,70,"Miranda is played by Meryl Streep, an actress who carries nuance in her every pore, and who endows even her lighthearted comic roles with a rich implication of inner life.

The Silence Before Bach,Manohla Dargis,70,70,"The film demands engagement and a kind of surrender, a willingness to enter into a work shaped by correlation, metaphor and metonymy, by beautiful images and fragments of ideas, a work that locates the music in the twitching of a dog’s ears, in the curve of a woman’s belly, a child’s song and an adult’s reverie.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-silence-before-bach/details

The Terminal,Dana Stevens,55,70,"Rarely have I been so acutely aware of a movie's softness and sentimentality, and rarely have I minded less.

The Color Purple,Janet Maslin,78,70,"Some parts of it are rapturous and stirring, others hugely improbable, and the film moves unpredictably from one mode to another. From another director, this might be fatally confusing, but Mr. Spielberg's showmanship is still with him. Although the combination of his sensibilities and Miss Walker's amounts to a colossal mismatch, Mr. Spielberg's ''Color Purple'' manages to have momentum, warmth and staying power all the same.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-color-purple/details
The Astronaut Farmer,A.O.

The Silence,A.O.

The Housemaid,A.O. Scott,68,70,"An admiring, clever remake of Kim Ki-young's legendary film of the same title from 1960, this version, directed by Im Sang-soo, is at once more explicit than the original and less kinky.","Jan 20, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-housemaid/details

River's Edge,Janet Maslin,73,70,"Mr. Hunter has an extraordinarily clear understanding of teen-age characters, especially those who must find their own paths without much parental supervision. Though its Midwestern locale and lower socioeconomic stratum give it a different setting, River's Edge shares something with Bret Easton Ellis's Less Than Zero, a novel that is also full of directionless, drug-taking teen-age characters who are without moral moorings and left entirely to their own devices. This is as chilling to witness as it is difficult to dramatize, if only because at their centers these lives are already so empty.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rivers-edge/details

The Cuckoo,Dave Kehr,69,70,There are subtitles to reduce everything to simple English declarative sentences.

The Salvation,Manohla Dargis,64,70,"This is, it’s worth remembering, a movie set in the American West that was shot in South Africa by a Danish director with a Danish star.

Double Take,A.O. Scott,66,70,"Although it is composed mainly of archival footage and touches on a great many actual events, Double Take, as you may already have gathered, is not quite a documentary.

Greedy Lying Bastards,Jeannette Catsoulis,56,70,"Collated for momentum, the film’s many interviews, wide-ranging archival footage and montage of modern ecological disasters form a blunt but carefully positioned instrument.

Refined sensibilities may understandably recoil from all this: high art is not among the aspirations of Porky's II. But lots of lowdown fun? Well, that's another matter.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/porkys-ii-the-next-day/details
The Fallen,Jeannette Catsoulis,62,70,"Directed by Ari Taub with a naturalistic style and a nonpartisan eye, The Fallen finds its humanity in the dailiness of a soldier's life, in the long stretches of nothing, where tensions swell and the killing of a deer can spark a mutiny.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-fallen/details
American Hardcore,Stephen Holden,69,70,"A toned-down cinematic equivalent of the music: fast and loud, but not too loud.

Thor: Ragnarok,Manohla Dargis,73,70,"Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while.","Nov  1, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/thor-ragnarok/details
Mifune: The Last Samurai,Ben Kenigsberg,64,70,"It’s a brisk and energetic primer for those who don’t know his movies or are ready to watch them again.

Nobody Walks,Stephen Holden,51,70,"It would be tempting to dismiss Nobody Walks as a trivial erotic divertissement, even more so because it doesn't apply the kind of symbolic gloss found in a '60s film of serial seduction, like Pasolini's ""Teorema.""

The Princess of Montpensier,Manohla Dargis,78,70,"The French director Bertrand Tavernier deploys some smart ideas in this film, a period story about wars on the battlefield and those closer to home, but there's something a bit goatish in his attention to some female charms.","Apr 14, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-princess-of-montpensier/details

Fright Night,A.O.

Cymbeline,Manohla Dargis,54,70,"Cymbeline has been branded a tragedy, a tragicomedy and a romance, and Mr. Almereyda embraces all three categories. The movie is by turns grim, grimly amusing and romantic, sometimes at once.","Mar 12, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cymbeline/details

The Raid 2,Nicolas Rapold,71,70,"The pleasant surprise of Gareth Evans’s sturdy sequel to “The Raid: Redemption” is that neither its undercover drama nor its two-and-a-half-hour length bog down the bracing, and numerous, fight fests.","Mar 27, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-raid-2/details

Journey from the Fall,,70,70,"The film depicts one family's endurance in sturdy, old-movie style, with sweeping camerawork, a monumental and occasionally intrusive orchestral score, gorgeous yet forbidding natural vistas and enough shocking tragedies, brazen escapes and crowd-pleasing acts of defiance to fuel several action-adventure pictures.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/journey-from-the-fall/details
Awake: The Life of Yogananda,Anita Gates,54,70,"The film’s storytelling is straightforward, almost standard-issue, but the story itself is compelling, as is the testimony of devotees.","Oct  9, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/awake-the-life-of-yogananda/details

Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!,Rachel Saltz,tbd,70,"The twisty story has a kink or two too many, a problem of whodunit plotting rather than of Bollywood excess.

Brave,Manohla Dargis,69,70,"The tussling between Elinor and Merida is familiar, but while the mother-daughter clashes may make the story ""relatable,"" they drain it of its mythopoetic potential, turning what could have been a cool postmodern fairy tale into another family melodrama.","Jun 21, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/brave/details
The Ground Truth,Stephen Holden,74,70,"Tries to do too much in too little time. It would be a stronger film if it devoted more detailed attention to the plight of the returning veteran. As it stands, it is a scattershot antiwar polemic that doesn't bolster its arguments with any historical perspective or statistical evidence.

By the Sea,Manohla Dargis,44,70,"At first luxurious blush it’s a jet-setting marital melodrama, one of those he-said, she-said (and wept) encounter sessions decked with designer shades, to-die-for digs and millionaire tears. More interestingly, the movie, which Ms. Jolie Pitt wrote and directed, is a knowing or at least a ticklishly amusing demonstration of celebrity and its relay of gazes from one of the most looked-at women in the world.","Nov 12, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/by-the-sea/details

Caroline and Jackie,Anita Gates,60,70,"With low-key, almost guileless performances, the film demonstrates that no matter how intelligent, well thought out and potentially enlightened a current sociological method (e.g., the “loving intervention”) may be, people will always find a way to turn it into something ludicrous, aggressive or both.","May  2, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/caroline-and-jackie/details

Terminator 2: Judgment Day,Janet Maslin,75,70,"Mr. Cameron has made a swift, exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves upon the first film's potent but rudimentary visual style.

Coming to America,Vincent Canby,47,70,"Though Coming to America is a romantic comedy the director steers the film more often toward quick, in-and-out comic situations and gags that are only mildly funny. In part this is due to the fact that Mr. Murphy plays the prince with cheerful, low-keyed innocence that is completely legitimate, but is not supported by the short attention span of the screenplay.

Heaven Knows What,Nicolas Rapold,75,70,"The Safdie brothers capture a density of activity as endemic to the city as it is to Harley’s daily hustle.

Whip It,A.O.

The Infiltrator,Stephen Holden,66,70,"Robert is not a Shakespearean figure like Walter White, but the film at least grants him the moral stature of an incorruptible man risking his life in a dangerous job.

Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping,A.O. Scott,68,70,"“Popstar” takes aim at everything that is artificial and plastic in contemporary pop in a spirit of love rather than spite.

Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert,Andy Webster,59,70,"What you do see are diverting 3-D effects and lots of playing to the camera by Ms. Cyrus, who performs as both herself and as her television alter ego, Hannah Montana.

Dolls,Stephen Holden,71,70,"With some staggeringly beautiful photography of cherry blossoms and scarlet autumn leaves, Dolls is so enthralled with its own cinematography that it can't bear to edit itself, and during the autumn and winter segments of the bound beggars' journey, it almost reaches a standstill.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dolls/details

Lila Says,Dana Stevens,57,70,"Ms. Giocante's intoxicating mixture of gamine innocence and womanly knowingness is almost too much for the movie - Lila is surely too much for Chimo - but her charisma, and Mr. Doueiri's insouciant, heart-on-the-sleeve style give it a mood that is at once breathlessly romantic and cannily down to earth.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lila-says/details
My Friend Dahmer,Glenn Kenny,68,70,"This film is sensitively wrought. It’s credible in its evocation of mid-’70s suburbia. The acting is excellent throughout, and Ross Lynch in the role of Dahmer elicits genuine sympathy for an increasingly lost but not yet monstrous soul.

Blue Crush,Dana Stevens,61,70,"It's hard to resist being swept up in Blue Crush, not least because David Hennings's shimmery photography carries the breeze and spray of the island right into the theater.

The Flower of My Secret,Caryn James,75,70,"[Almodovar’s] returns to the mordant but sympathetic comedy of his early, best work.

The Jeffrey Dahmer Files,Jeannette Catsoulis,61,70,"If the film’s spare re-enactments are a little awkward, they also smartly repurpose Dahmer’s studied reserve into a meditation on perversion as hypnotic as it is repulsive.","Feb 14, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-jeffrey-dahmer-files/details
Men on the Bridge,Andy Webster,60,70,"A powerful portrait of working-class Istanbul that artfully suggests a wellspring of found moments. Quietly, steadily, it gathers a resonance belying its slice-of-life scale.","Jun 19, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/men-on-the-bridge/details

Last Days Here,Jeannette Catsoulis,71,70,"Nevertheless the fierce loyalty of Mr. Liebling's nearest and dearest is extremely touching, and Last Days Here - despite its stinginess with back story and early performance footage - works hard to reveal the man beneath the four-decade heroin habit.","Mar  1, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/last-days-here/details

Smokey and the Bandit II,Vincent Canby,41,70,"The screenplay, by Jerry Belson and Brock Yates, is not so surreally funny as the one for the first film, but funny lines are not what the picture is about.

Americano,A.O. Scott,50,70,"Though not explicitly autobiographical, this film is deeply personal, and while the nature of cinema is very much on its mind, it rarely feels insular or self-conscious.

Paris,Stephen Holden,68,70,"There are enough intersecting characters from different classes and backgrounds in Paris to evoke the city as a complex, healthy organism, whose parts are all connected.

Snowden,A.O. Scott,58,70,"Mr. Stone has made an honorable and absorbing contribution to the imaginative record of our confusing times.

In Another Country,A.O. Scott,69,70,"What the point here might be is a bit more elusive.

Around The World In 50 Concerts,Rachel Saltz,76,70,"If the movie gets a bit gooey at times that’s probably an occupational hazard when considering the sublime.

Savages,A.O. Scott,59,70,"Savages is a daylight noir, a western, a stoner buddy movie and a love story, which is to say that it is a bit of a mess.

Café de Flore,Stephen Holden,53,70,"It must be said that Café de Flore is true to its hyper-romantic belief system. And unlike most movies in the ""Touched by an Angel"" school of storytelling, it doesn't descend into cheap sentimentality. It may be hokum, but it is sophisticated hokum.","Nov  8, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cafe-de-flore/details
Alien: Resurrection,Elvis Mitchell,63,70,Tauntingly flirtatious scenes between Ms. Ryder and Ms. Weaver give this film a sexual boldness that the others' action-adventure spirit lacked.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/alien-resurrection/details

Blaze,Janet Maslin,67,70,"Blaze has been beautifully photographed by Haskell Wexler in the soft, lulling colors of the Louisiana countryside, against which Ms. Davidovich's amusingly garish costumes stand out as markedly as they're meant to. The costumes, by Ruth Myers, are particularly good, with ice-cream-colored suits for Mr. Newman that allow him to dominate the film visually just as surely as he dominates it dramatically.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blaze/details

Raja Natwarlal,Rachel Saltz,tbd,70,"Mr. Deshmukh’s setup can be overly fussy — some of the con machinations seem needlessly complicated and hard to follow, or maybe not quite worth following — but his payoff works.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,Manohla Dargis,76,70,"Catching Fire isn’t a great work of art but it’s a competent, at times exciting movie and it does something that better, more artistically notable movies often fail to do: It speaks to its moment in time.","Nov 21, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hunger-games-catching-fire/details

Unveiled,Dana Stevens,60,70,"With its deliberately overexposed film stock and driving electronic score, Ms. Maccarone's film occasionally suffers from a self-conscious artiness, but at its center is an extraordinary performance by Ms. Tabatabai as Fariba, a young woman whose expectations have been lowered by a lifetime of systematic mistreatment but who still holds out hope for the possibility of both justice and love.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/unveiled/details
Les amitiés maléfiques,A.O. Scott,75,70,"As a group portrait of apprentice intellectuals the film has an almost documentary accuracy.

Two Lovers,A.O. Scott,74,70,"The flaws in Two Lovers are inseparable from its strengths.

Noah,A.O. Scott,68,70,"Mr. Aronofsky’s earnest, uneven, intermittently powerful film, is both a psychological case study and a parable of hubris and humility.

The Running Man,Vincent Canby,45,70,"Has the manners and the gadgetry of a sci-fi adventure film but is, at heart, an engagingly mean, cruel, nasty, funny send-up of television. It's not quite Network, but then it also doesn't take itself too seriously.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-running-man/details
Misery,Vincent Canby,75,70,"It seems to want to be a Hitchcockian kind of cat-and-mouse suspense melodrama, which demands a lot more ingenuity than Mr. Reiner or Mr. Goldman ever muster. Misery is just good enough that one wishes it were far better. The ideas are there, but they become lost in the heavy-handed treatment.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/misery/details

Senna,Stephen Holden,79,70,"As a personality profile, Senna is sketchy at best. Born into a well-to-do family in São Paulo, Brazil, Senna pursued the sport from a young age with a maniacal zeal.

My Scientology Movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,62,70,"My Scientology Movie relies on a shaggy, meandering charm.

Amazing Grace,Manohla Dargis,65,70,"The overall effect is part BBC-style biography, part Hollywood-like hagiography, and generally pleasing and often moving, even when the story wobbles off the historical rails or becomes bogged down in dopey romance.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/amazing-grace/details
Young Ones,Jeannette Catsoulis,47,70,"This spare but potent melodrama revels in the desiccated landscapes provided by South Africa and photographed with dusty purity by Giles Nuttgens.

Penance,Nicolas Rapold,58,70,"Mr. Kurosawa expertly modulates an uncanny flow of energies between shame and grief, between venal urges and high-minded moral demands.

Rudo y Cursi,A.O. Scott,67,70,"While the film is lively and engaging, it also, in the end, feels a little thin, largely because it is unsure of how earnestly to treat its own lessons about fate, ambition and brotherly love.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rudo-y-cursi/details
Molly's Theory of Relativity,Stephen Holden,40,70,"Molly’s Theory of Relativity is an intentionally uncomfortable movie to watch.

The Young Victoria,Manohla Dargis,64,70,"Despite the filmmakers’ efforts to persuade us that The Young Victoria is a serious work, and despite some tense moments and gunfire, the movie’s pleasures are as light as its story.

Last Flag Flying,A.O.

Paris 05:59: Théo & Hugo,Jeannette Catsoulis,74,70,"Light on plot yet heavy on chemistry, Paris 05:59 is at times a little precious.

Under the Boardwalk: The Monopoly Story,Neil Genzlinger,63,70,"The film bounces around enjoyably, giving a history of the game, talking to people who love it and chronicling the 2009 Monopoly World Championships in Las Vegas.","May  6, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/under-the-boardwalk-the-monopoly-story/details

The Other F Word,Jeannette Catsoulis,60,70,"What begins as an amusing fluff piece (""Daddy's messed up,"" mumbles one woozy subject after dropping his gurgling infant) slowly emerges as a compelling and often touching peek at punk paternity.","Nov  1, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-other-f-word/details

$9.99,A.O. Scott,68,70,"Though $9.99 manages to be quirky and enigmatic, it is in the end too self-conscious, too satisfied in its eccentricity, to achieve the full mysteriousness toward which it seems to aspire.

Sharky's Machine,Janet Maslin,58,70,"Mr. Reynolds's third and best directorial effort - the first two were Gator and The End - is an unexpectedly accomplished cop thriller. There is, as is often the case with movies of that genre, less here than meets the eye: the plot has its unreasonable spots, and the story doesn't come to much in the end. But one measure of the success of Sharky's Machine is that it's too fast and exciting for those considerations to count until after the movie is over.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sharkys-machine/details
11/8/16,Ken Jaworowski,62,70,"Considering all that’s been written and said over the last year, there’s not much new to learn from 11/8/16.

Machete,Stephen Holden,60,70,"For all its political button pushing, Machete is too preposterous to qualify as satire.

Ghosts of the Abyss,Dave Kehr,67,70,"Whether he's working in nonfiction or science fiction, Mr. Cameron remains an artist of great instinctive power.

Greenwich Village: Music That Defined a Generation,Stephen Holden,65,70,"Evokes the flavor of the era just before the music business exploded into a mass-market juggernaut.

The Monster,Manohla Dargis,69,70,"Part of the ticklish enjoyment in The Monster is how the director, Bryan Bertino (“The Strangers”), plays with genre registers and how, after opening with disquieting stillness and an isolated child, he slowly yet surely turns up the shrieks.","Nov 10, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-monster/details

The Transfiguration,Andy Webster,65,70,"Mr. Ruffin must carry the film, projecting interior activity and suggesting information where the script (by Mr. O’Shea) does not.

Ghostland: The View of the Ju/’hoansi,Glenn Kenny,tbd,70,"This is an engaging movie depicting some sympathetic people, and is ultimately worthwhile.

The Central Park Five,Manohla Dargis,79,70,"Measured in tone and outraged in its argument, it is an emotionally stirring, at times crushingly depressing cinematic call to witness.

Youth Without Youth,Manohla Dargis,43,70,"In this film Mr. Coppola blurs dreams and everyday life and suggests that through visual and narrative experimentation he has begun the search for new ways of making meaning, new holy places for him and for us.

Welcome to this House,Andy Webster,tbd,70,"Ms. Hammer’s gauzier sequences notwithstanding, the film’s most commanding image is the housekeeper’s description of the ruthless monasticism Bishop maintained and the compulsive writing she practiced in her studio.

Cape Fear,Bosley Crowther,76,70,"Technically, it's a good job. Mr. Webb has prepared a tough, tight script and Mr. Thompson has directed in a steady and starkly sinister style. There is no waste motion, no fooling. Everything is sharp and direct. Menace quivers in the picture like a sneaky electrical charge. And Mr. Mitchum plays the villain with the cheekiest, wickedest arrogance and the most relentless aura of sadism that he has ever managed to generate...But this is really one of those shockers that provokes disgust and regret. There seems to be no reason for it but to agitate anguish and a violent, vengeful urge that is offered some animal satisfaction by that murderous fight at the end.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cape-fear-1962/details

The Age of Shadows,Ken Jaworowski,78,70,"The Age of Shadows might tempt another filmmaker to dwell on issues or delve deeper into its characters’ hearts.

David Hockney: The Colors of Music,Janet Maslin,63,70,"Over all, this deferential film salutes Mr. Hockney's artistry as an elixir for creaky texts, a hallucinogen for orthodox opera fans, and an antidote to his own senescence.

Aurangzeb,Rachel Saltz,tbd,70,"The plot of Aurangzeb is inevitably too complicated, and the themes presented more interestingly than they are wrapped up.

Portrait of Wally,Nicolas Rapold,70,70,"The film's single-minded treatment puts property issues over other nuances of the affair, not least the art itself and the artist.

Happy Feet,Manohla Dargis,77,70,"While compromised by the uplift and affirmation that mainstream animation regurgitates like a mommy penguin, it also shows a remarkable persistence of vision.

A Thousand Years of Good Prayers,Nathan Lee,64,70,"A gentle, pleasantly unrushed piece of moviemaking.

Story of My Death,Nicolas Rapold,80,70,"Mr. Serra has said his film portrays the eclipse of Enlightenment rationality by the violent forces of Romanticism.

The Armstrong Lie,Stephen Holden,67,70,"More glaringly than most sports documentaries, The Armstrong Lie reinforces the sad truth that the adage “It’s not whether you win or lose, it’s how you play the game” doesn’t apply to professional sports.

Km. 0 - Kilometer Zero,Dave Kehr,51,70,"Unfolds, skipping blithely from comic to melodramatic vignettes and back again, it follows the classical structure of a Shakespearean forest comedy, sorting out the mismatched couples and finding appropriate mates (or at least appropriate friendships) for everyone involved.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/km-0---kilometer-zero/details

21 Jump Street,A.O. Scott,69,70,"It wants to be fun and, to a perhaps surprising extent, it is. Largely forsaking the sweet multiculturalism of the original for white-dude bromance, and completely abandoning earnest teenagers-in-crisis melodrama in favor of crude, aggressive comedy, this 21 Jump Street is an example of how formula-driven entertainment can succeed.","Mar 15, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/21-jump-street/details

Far From Men,Manohla Dargis,74,70,"Camus sets the movie’s initial course, but Mr. Oelhoffen resolutely steers it home with political context, historical hindsight, an unambiguous moral imperative and a pair of well-matched performances; put another way, he makes the story his own.","Apr 30, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/far-from-men/details
Little Nicky,Dana Stevens,38,60,"It's a clever idea bogged down in sophomoric sloppiness. Sitting through it doesn't feel like eternal damnation, but it's not exactly heaven, either. It's a $9.50 tour of adolescent purgatory.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/little-nicky/details

Union Square,A.O. Scott,55,60,"Union Square has the busy, hemmed-in talkiness of a theater piece, with too much forced to happen in too short a time.

The LEGO Movie,A.O. Scott,83,60,"The visual environment created by the filmmakers (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of “21 Jump Street” wrote and directed; the animation is by Animal Logic) hums with wit and imagination...

The Manchurian Candidate,Bosley Crowther,94,60,"The film is so artfully contrived, the plot so interestingly started, the dialogue so racy and sharp, and John Frankenheimer's direction so exciting in the style of Orson Welles when he was making Citizen Kane and other pictures that the fascination of it is strong.

Loving Vincent,A.O. Scott,62,60,"As the story limps and drags, the viewer also becomes accustomed to the images, and astonishment at the film’s innovative, painstaking technique begins to fade.

Fort Bliss,Manohla Dargis,68,60,"Ms. Myers too often tells rather than shows, and she doesn’t have the cinematic skill set to transform her idea into a fully satisfying movie, especially at this low-budget level.","Sep 18, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fort-bliss/details
9 Star Hotel,Jeannette Catsoulis,72,60,"By ignoring Israeli voices and focusing only on the immigrants, Mr. Haar has produced a documentary filled with immediacy but free of analysis, a fascinating but ultimately unenlightening record of their plight.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/9-star-hotel/details
LOL,Nathan Lee,63,60,"Authentic in texture if narrow in scope, LOL is a movie about the way we live -- or rather about the way white, urban, heterosexual circuit boys are failing to live.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lol/details

Hollywood Dreams,Jeannette Catsoulis,52,60,"Knowing but never jaded, Hollywood Dreams is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. In Mr. Jaglom's maverick hands, the appeal of illusion over reality is both fatal and irresistible.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hollywood-dreams/details

The Blonds,Dana Stevens,63,60,"It is not so much a documentary as a fictional film about the making of a documentary, or perhaps a documentary about the making of a fictional film about the making of a documentary.

Mommie Dearest,Janet Maslin,55,60,"Miss Dunaway gives the uncanny, meticulous Crawford imitation that is at the heart of Mommie Dearest. The movie itself has nothing like the brilliance of the impression, which is why it remains an impression and can't altogether rise to the level of a performance. But on its own terms Miss Dunaway's work here amounts to a small miracle, as one movie queen transforms herself passionately and wholeheartedly into another.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mommie-dearest/details

People Like Us,Stephen Holden,49,60,"If its tone is considerably tougher than that of movies adapted from Nicholas Sparks novels, it is still a grown-up soap opera.

Janeane from Des Moines,Daniel M.

Battle for Haditha,Manohla Dargis,65,60,"Mr. Broomfield maintains a level of cool detachment throughout.

Rosemary's Baby,,96,60,"Miss Farrow is quite marvelous, pale, suffering, almost constantly on-screen in a difficult role that requires her to be learning for almost two hours what the audience has guessed from the start...Everyone else is fine, but the movie—although it is pleasant—doesn't quite work on any of its dark or powerful terms.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rosemarys-baby/details
Runaway Bride,Elvis Mitchell,39,60,"More often, the film is like a ride through a car wash: forward motion, familiar phases in the same old order and a sense of being carried along steadily on a well-used track. It works without exactly showing signs of life.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/runaway-bride/details
Holiday,Rachel Saltz,tbd,60,"The action sequences mostly have tension and punch, even if the movie is old-school long — 2 hours 41 minutes — and the plot doesn’t bear too much scrutiny.","Jun 16, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/holiday/details

Altered States,Janet Maslin,58,60,"The film is in fine shape as long as it revels in its own craziness, making no claims on the viewer's reason.

Maya the Bee Movie,Neil Genzlinger,49,60,"The film’s messages about friendship, acceptance and being yourself are clear enough for the young, and grown-ups can read the story as a warning about conformity and about going to war on false pretenses.","Apr 30, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/maya-the-bee-movie/details
Suicide Squad,A.O. Scott,40,60,"Suicide Squad is a so-so, off-peak superhero movie. It chases after the nihilistic swagger of “Deadpool” and the anarchic whimsy of “Guardians of the Galaxy” but trips over its own feet.","Aug  3, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/suicide-squad/details
Trudell,Jeannette Catsoulis,48,60,"No one in the film has a bad word to say about Mr. Trudell, despite his 17,000-page F.B.I. dossier; and by the time Robert Redford assures us that meeting him is not dissimilar to meeting the Dalai Lama, you may feel that all this worship does not do justice to an unusually stormy and complicated life.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/trudell/details
The Culture High,Daniel M. Gold,37,60,"Some of this seems like stoner’s paranoia, and some of the film’s talking heads, mainly comedians, don’t make the best advocates.

Heartless,Manohla Dargis,58,60,"Best appreciated for its sustained creepy vibe and sporadically arresting images, Heartless moves from one outré moment to another, from one self-conscious allusion to the next (""Donnie Darko"" and ""Taxi Driver"").

Unforgivable,Manohla Dargis,66,60,"Unforgivable isn't one of Mr. Téchiné's greatest achievements, but it's engrossing even when its increasingly populated story falters, tripped up by unpersuasive actions, connections and details.","Jun 28, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/unforgivable/details
Voyage of Time: The IMAX Experience,A.O. Scott,77,60,Mr. Malick presents these events as if he had drawn them not from his mind but from some repository of celestial memory.

Miss Julie,Stephen Holden,56,60,"Aside from the change of setting, Ms. Ullmann’s version is quite orthodox.

Louder Than Bombs,A.O. Scott,70,60,"It is possible to admire the craft and sensitivity of Louder Than Bombs without quite believing it.

Cyrus,Manohla Dargis,74,60,"Cyrus is more finely tuned than their earlier movies (""The Puffy Chair,"" ""Baghead""), but it shares a similar, almost aggressive lack of ambition. John doesn't work hard and neither do the Duplasses, who don't want their audiences to break a sweat either.

Drew: The Man Behind the Poster,Andy Webster,59,60,"At length, the cheerleading...becomes a mildly taxing torrent.

Kisses,Stephen Holden,68,60,"Kisses may strike you as either ingeniously magical or insufferably cute, depending on your taste.

Herblock: The Black & the White,Nicolas Rapold,70,60,"It’s fortunate that the cartoons on display are such instantly satisfying works of popular genius, because, despite its subject, “Herblock” shows how even an edifying talking-heads documentary bumps up against the limitations of the format.","Aug 15, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/herblock-the-black-the-white/details
The Trials of Muhammad Ali,Nicolas Rapold,74,60,"The film falls short of explaining Mr. Ali, who, like many outspoken individuals, can stubbornly repel scrutiny, nor will it pacify the many who opposed his conscientious objections.

What Dreams May Come,Stephen Holden,44,60,"What Dreams May Come, based on a novel by Richard Matheson and directed by Vincent Ward, the New Zealand filmmaker noted for his skill at creating lavish cinematic dreamscapes, represents the uncomfortable collision of two ideas about filmmaking, one commercial, the other eccentrically, ambitiously dreamy.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/what-dreams-may-come/details
Tea with Mussolini,Stephen Holden,53,60,"Once you accept the notion that Tea With Mussolini aspires to be little more than a kind of British-Italian ''Steel Magnolias,'' with a patina of World War II-movie uplift, it becomes a pleasure to watch its stars shamelessly hamming it up.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tea-with-mussolini/details
Formosa Betrayed,Stephen Holden,52,60,"Mr. Van Der Beek, manlier than in his “Dawson Creek” days, gives an able performance in a movie whose Asian actors tend to overplay the intrigue in an exaggerated 1940s style, exchanging sinister meaningful looks and, in general, hamming it up.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/formosa-betrayed/details
Natural Resistance,Ben Kenigsberg,tbd,60,"Mr. Nossiter’s main point is that traditional farming methods have become revolutionary in a country that, we’re told, has grown progressively less agrarian.

Turkey Bowl,Neil Genzlinger,52,60,"A quirky offering by Kyle Smith that does nothing more or less than show a touch-football game among friends. ""It's sort of interesting,"" you might find yourself saying, ""but is it a film?""","Jun  2, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/turkey-bowl/details
A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,Janet Maslin,49,60,"Freddy Krueger is the most talkative of slashers, and also the most creative.

It's the Earth Not the Moon,Daniel M. Gold,tbd,60,The film's leisurely pace seems to capture the rhythms of island life.

Red Heat,Vincent Canby,61,60,"Red Heat is a topically entertaining variation on the sort of action-adventure nonsense that plays best on television.

Oldboy,A.O. Scott,49,60,"If you have seen the earlier version, you can occupy yourself with point-by-point comparisons.

Appaloosa,A.O. Scott,64,60,"The movie's tolerant, good-humored view of its characters drains it of some dramatic intensity, but Mr. Harris seems more interested in piquant, offhand moments than in big, straining confrontations.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/appaloosa/details
The Recruit,Dana Stevens,56,60,"Like Christopher Walken or Marlon Brando, Mr. Pacino frequently uses his gifts to make mediocre movies more interesting. Everything else in The Recruit may be tiresomely predictable, but he, at least, is not.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-recruit/details
Freestyle: The Art of Rhyme,Dana Stevens,63,60,"The skills on display in Freestyle are too varied and idiosyncratic for one movie to contain, but this one at least offers a heady, rousing education in an art form that is too often misunderstood.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/freestyle-the-art-of-rhyme/details
The Source Family,Jeannette Catsoulis,62,60,"Unearthing a decent sample of these former members, as well as a wealth of archival film and photographs, the directors elicit testimony that’s diversely sharp, spacey, nostalgic and heartbreaking.","Apr 30, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-source-family/details

Stations of the Cross,Stephen Holden,68,60,"As Maria crumples before our eyes, many will find Stations of the Cross heartbreaking and infuriating.

Eros,Dana Stevens,51,60,"Lovely though it is to look at, it does not reveal very much.

Men in Black II,Dana Stevens,49,60,"As fizzy as the first, but not quite as refreshing. The pleasurable, eye-popping sense of surprise has diminished, and the teasingly referential attitude shows signs of fatigue.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/men-in-black-ii/details
One Lucky Elephant,Manohla Dargis,71,60,"Animal people sometimes say the wackiest things, but here, alas, they never satisfyingly address the ethical questions of what it means to capture and keep wild animals.

Invisible,Stephen Holden,63,60,The insensitivity of the news media and law enforcement is an implicit acknowledgment of the gap between men and women on the issue; in the film's view men just don't get it.

The film is less successful in depicting their personal lives.,"Jul 10, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/invisible-1969/details

Awakenings,Janet Maslin,74,60,"Awakenings both sentimentalizes its story and oversimplifies it beyond recognition. At no point does the film express more than one idea at a time.

Touching Home,Stephen Holden,52,60,"Suffused with a glow of apple-cheeked nostalgia that often clings to baseball movies. The movie may be set in the present, but its likable clean-cut twins exude more than a whiff of gee-whiz 1950s innocence.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/touching-home/details

How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog,Stephen Holden,40,60,"Reminds us that when it comes to comedy, it's all in the writing.

The Signal,,63,60,"Part 1, directed by David Bruckner is superb, with affecting performances, a sense of dread reminiscent of John Carpenter’s “Prince of Darkness” and many striking images. Part 2, directed by Dan Bush aims for George Romero-style ghastly humor, but it’s more grating than funny. Part 3, directed by Jacob Gentry adds a splash of tragic love, but its preference for gore over feeling becomes monotonous.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-signal/details
Honeydripper,Stephen Holden,68,60,"Honeydripper is agreeable, well-intentioned and very, very slow. Sadly, it illustrates the difference between an archetype and a stereotype.

How to Grow a Band,Nicolas Rapold,57,60,Ego struggles and innovator's laments (nobody gets us!) are a refrain in many band documentaries. How to Grow a Band adds a modest but effective entry to the genre's back catalog.,"Apr 12, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/how-to-grow-a-band/details

The Outrageous Sophie Tucker,Manohla Dargis,59,60,"The movie isn’t especially well made, yet because Tucker is such a gloriously rich figure — immigrant turned runaway mother turned vaudevillian turned superstar — she renders its formal and aesthetic shortcomings (mostly) irrelevant.","Jul 23, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-outrageous-sophie-tucker/details
Ways to Live Forever,Jeannette Catsoulis,59,60,"A little wan but a lot likable, Gustavo Ron’s Ways to Live Forever is a forthright and surprisingly buoyant drama about facing death before you have really lived.","Jul 18, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ways-to-live-forever/details
Difret,Nicolas Rapold,61,60,"Shot in sunny locales, Difret has an earnestness that hovers between plain-spoken and pedestrian, and there are scenes and sequences that just don’t come together as written and edited, no matter how admirable the film’s existence is.","Oct 22, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/difret/details

Open Water,Dana Stevens,63,60,"The sharks are scary, and the ocean is vast and indifferent, but the most effective parts of Open Water, which is ultimately too modest to be very memorable, evoke a deeper terror, one that can chill even those viewers who would never dream of putting on a wet suit and jumping off a boat.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/open-water/details
Bottle Rocket,Elvis Mitchell,65,60,"A mildly facetious tone limits Anderson's film to the lightweight, but the collective enthusiasm behind this debut effort still comes through.

The Salt of the Earth,A.O. Scott,83,60,"The Salt of the Earth leaves no doubt about Mr. Salgado’s talent or decency, and the chance to spend time in his company is a reason for gratitude.

The Sweeney,Jeannette Catsoulis,48,60,"Simon Dennis’s photography is glossy and crisp, and a lengthy foot chase — making excellent use of the National Gallery — is inventively choreographed.

"Arabian Nights: Volume 1, The Restless One",A.O. Scott,80,60,"Mr. Gomes has a tendency to revel in his own cleverness and to indulge in self-conscious cinematic jokes.

Exist,Nathan Lee,44,60,"Properly speaking, Exist is not a protest film but a protest video - the grass-roots medium of choice - and Ms. Bell makes good use of the technology.

The Magnificent Seven,Manohla Dargis,54,60,"The new movie is as moth-eaten as the serapes strewn through the 1960 film, but there’s no denying the appeal of the image of Mr. Washington riding a horse, shooting a Colt and leading a posse of vigilantes to save a mostly white Western town.","Sep 22, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-magnificent-seven-2016/details
The Maid's Room,Ben Kenigsberg,39,60,"The Maid’s Room has much to recommend, including the versatile Mr. Camp (“Tamara Drewe,” “Compliance”) in a Machiavellian role.

"Arabian Nights: Volume 3, The Enchanted One",A.O. Scott,80,60,"There is a fine line between delving into the mysteries of life and engaging in mystification, and Mr. Gomes lands on the wrong side of it. There is something disingenuous in the way this movie disowns its own ambitions and scorns the possibility of clarity or coherence. Maybe its opacity is a matter of principle.

Homefront,Manohla Dargis,40,60,"The movie is as blunt an instrument as the poster, but it’s also crammed with enough moving parts and unexpected distractions (Winona Ryder as a “meth whore”) to make it an indefensibly enjoyable piece of exploitation hackwork.","Nov 26, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/homefront/details
Notorious,A.O. Scott,60,60,"Notorious settles into a curious comfort zone; it's half pop fable, half naturalistic docudrama. Not a bad movie, but nowhere near as strong as its soundtrack.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/notorious/details
Everybody Has a Plan,Rachel Saltz,49,60,"Mr. Mortensen keeps you watching, even when the movie’s storytelling underwhelms.

Hanna,Manohla Dargis,65,60,"In the end there might not be much to this tale other than titillation, but there's plenty to be said for Ms. Ronan, who was the best thing about ""Atonement"" and holds her ground against forceful screen presences like Ms. Blanchett and Mr. Bana.","Apr  7, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hanna/details
Irrational Man,Manohla Dargis,53,60,"The horror of where rationalism can lead (the death camps, for one) hangs over Irrational Man and helps hold you as does Mr. Phoenix, even with some bad writing and Mr. Allen’s narrative laxity and lack of interest in how real people live.","Jul 16, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/irrational-man/details

The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne,Nicolas Rapold,62,60,"The Life & Crimes of Doris Payne has an embarrassment of riches in Ms. Payne’s story, and it’s often a ripping good yarn, but, as a film, it lacks the nimbleness and resourcefulness of its subject.","May 28, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-life-and-crimes-of-doris-payne/details

The production is slick, the Maine scenery is bracing, the characters are well-acted, and in a mumbo-jumbo movie with a few loose ends, the makeup central to the plot and applied by Greg Cannom and Bob Laden to Robert John Burke in the leading role is most admirable.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/thinner/details

Enemies Closer,Neil Genzlinger,49,60,"With a manic performance by Jean-Claude Van Damme and an improbable but intriguing plot variation, Enemies Closer is an improvement over most hunt-or-be-hunted fare.

The Warriors,Janet Maslin,63,60,"The film is as handsome to watch as it is preposterous to listen to, full of gorgeous nocturnal city images that splash blaring neon colors against filthy, rain-slicked gray. Mr. Hill uses subways, jukeboxes, spectacularly eerie costumes and deserted streets to create a stark yet extravagant visual style, and a grimy little world in which everything looks curiously brand-new.

10 Years,Stephen Holden,61,60,"An unpretentious, well-acted ensemble piece that doesn't aspire to be a portentous generational time capsule like ""The Big Chill,"" ""American Graffiti"" or ""Diner.""

Its horrors are not horrible, its terrors are not terrifying, its violence is ludicrous—which may be an advantage—but it does move along.

Mimosas,Jeannette Catsoulis,64,60,"At best ambiguous and at worst unfathomable, Mimosas, the sophomore feature from the Spanish director Oliver Laxe, merges harsh reality and offbeat mysticism into a reflection on the tug between our higher powers and baser instincts.","Apr 13, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mimosas/details

A Moment of Silence,Helen T.

Llyn Foulkes One Man Band,Nicolas Rapold,63,60,"The filmmakers are blessed and cursed with a subject who seems to lack the usual filters.

The American,A.O.

Carrie,,85,60,"Mr. de Palma has ordered universal overacting. Piper Laurie does it with considerable grace—the wicked witch in a children's pantomime. The marvel, though, is Sissy Spacek. She makes us perfectly aware that she is overacting, and yet she is very effective. Her hysteria is far too hysterical. Her delight in being taken to the prom is far too radiant.

The Family,Stephen Holden,42,60,"The movie has holes galore. It has abrupt tonal shifts, an incoherent back story and abandoned subplots. It doesn’t even try for basic credibility.

Identity Thief,Manohla Dargis,35,60,"As is the case with other unsatisfactory diversions, it is entirely possible to ignore the worst parts of this movie, to drift along during the lulls, slide over the half-baked jokes and just wait for Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Bateman to do their things.","Feb  7, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/identity-thief/details
4:44 Last Day on Earth,A.O. Scott,54,60,"Your last day - or, as it happens, the whole planet's last day - will be just like every other one.

Mascots,Stephen Holden,57,60,"Although Mascots is neither as funny nor as satirically acute as its forerunner, it would be churlish to complain too loudly.

Perfect Sense,Stephen Holden,55,60,"The love story doesn't quite work. Mr. McGregor and Ms. Green make an attractive couple.

The Eye of the Storm,Manohla Dargis,55,60,"Whether she's lying in bed, her gray hair spilling out around her head, or exalting in existence itself during one of several flashbacks, Elizabeth draws you in, which works for the story and simultaneously unbalances it.","Sep  6, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-eye-of-the-storm/details

Once Upon a Time in the West (re-release),Vincent Canby,80,60,"The biggest, longest, most expensive Leone Western to date, and, in many ways, the most absurd...

Above and Beyond,Ben Kenigsberg,69,60,"These fond recollections of derring-do hail from a different era, and the movie’s one-sided view of history is bound to start arguments.

"Remember Me, My Love",Stephen Holden,53,60,"An abrasive but innovative fusion of farce, satire and drama that blurs their boundaries in uncomfortable ways. It's a noisy movie whose characters tend to talk at medium-to-high volume.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/remember-me-my-love/details

Cartel Land,Manohla Dargis,76,60,"Mr. Heineman has said that he wanted Cartel Land to feel like a narrative film as much as possible, and to an extent it does.

Come on Eileen,Jeannette Catsoulis,tbd,60,"Ms. Howe is frequently riveting: a scene in which she repeatedly, and with waxing abuse, drunk-calls her former husband (an excellent Keith Allen) may make more than a few viewers squirm in recognition.","Mar 22, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/come-on-eileen/details

The Shallows,Glenn Kenny,59,60,"Mr. Collet-Serra’s busy visual style, which uses a lot of fast-cutting, willy-nilly variations between slow and fast motion, and illogical but vivid point-of-view shots, seems at least somewhat apt under the exhilarating circumstances.","Jun 23, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-shallows/details
Korkoro,Rachel Saltz,60,60,"Korkoro (the word means freedom in Romani) has an unexpectedly leisurely quality as it shows the texture of Gypsy life - the music-making, the intense bonds with horses and the natural world - and its awkward fit with modernity.","Mar 24, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/korkoro/details

Kid Cannabis,Neil Genzlinger,54,60,"The film’s main distraction, oddly, is the voice-over through which Nate annotates the action.

Interiors,Vincent Canby,67,60,"Though the movie looks beautiful, the elegant style occasionally works against it, showing it up. This happens in a striking close-up of Miss Keaton, sitting alone on a photogenically windswept ocean beach as she is supposed to be thinking sensitive poet-type thoughts. Yet the image is empty.

Shin Godzilla (Godzilla Resurgence),Neil Genzlinger,67,60,"The film is at its best when it’s in parody mode, though it keeps that card too close to the vest for much of its two-hour length.

Go Grandriders,Miriam Bale,68,60,"It’s like a cheap, dry cake covered with a thick layer of frosting.

Contraband,Manohla Dargis,51,60,"The absurdity of the story in the largely thrill-free thriller Contraband, its hairpin twists and outrageous coincidences, may keep even hungry action fans away.

Katy Perry: Part of Me,A.O. Scott,57,60,"There are several reasons that Katy Perry: Part of Me is more interesting than similar movies about Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers.

Hitchcock,Manohla Dargis,55,60,"The movie has its diversions, including Scarlett Johansson's bodacious Janet Leigh and Michael Stuhlbarg's wheedling Lew Wasserman. It's fluff.

This Is the End,A.O. Scott,67,60,"The film, at its phoned-in worst and also at its riotous best, has a terminal feeling.

Anastasia,Stephen Holden,59,60,"A deeply silly movie, but it is sumptuous to look at, and it never stands still.

Wish Upon,Jeannette Catsoulis,32,60,"The splatter is deployed cautiously and sometimes wittily, the story moving briskly from wishes granted to costs exacted with the help of familiar faces (including a warm Sherilyn Fenn as Clare’s surrogate mother) and a sympathetic lead.","Jul 13, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/wish-upon/details
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,Janet Maslin,48,60,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a slight, good-humored film that's a lot more painless than might have been expected.

All's Well Ends Well ,David DeWitt,tbd,60,"No one is winning points for creativity here, but nice reflections on class and culture are in the mix, and the strong, playful acting knows this genre, even when flirting with broadness.","Jan 26, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/alls-well-ends-well-2011/details
The Waterboy,Elvis Mitchell,41,60,"This escapist comedy is so cheerfully outlandish that it's hard to resist, and so good-hearted that it's genuinely endearing.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-waterboy/details
My Cousin Rachel,Manohla Dargis,63,60,"It’s all very pretty, but too often the movie’s beauty isn’t tethered to deep feeling or strong ideas, one reason you may often find your eyes and thoughts drifting away from the quietly escalating drama toward the vast green fields, the majestic horses and nice detail work.","Jun  8, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/my-cousin-rachel/details
More Than the Rainbow,Nicolas Rapold,67,60,"Mr. Wechsler’s film might be loose to a fault, but Mr. Weber’s work yields its share of gratifying, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it New York moments.","May  1, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/more-than-the-rainbow/details

Usher,Jeannette Catsoulis,tbd,60,"But if Usher is stilted, it is also quite touching, and if Mr. Harrington's acting is less than natural, it's completely in line with the standards of the genre. Vincent Price was no Olivier either.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/usher/details
My Old Lady,Stephen Holden,52,60,"As the truth tumbles out, the dialogue and the carefully timed revelations make My Old Lady seem increasingly stagy.

Last Letters from Monte Rosa,Mike Hale,tbd,60,"What leaves a bad taste in the mouth is not the film itself, which is passable for a low-budget war picture, but the fact that neither the official Web site nor the press notes even suggest that it largely has been scavenged from an existing movie.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/last-letters-from-monte-rosa/details

Invasion of the Body Snatchers,Janet Maslin,75,60,"The screenplay, by W. D. Richter, remains bright and lively throughout, but the plot just isn't full enough to carry a feature film.

Take Every Wave: The Life of Laird Hamilton,Ben Kenigsberg,66,60,"The documentary stirs up most of its sporadic excitement in the surfing footage, of which there is plenty.

The Myth of Fingerprints,Stephen Holden,58,60,"Has some good performances (Ms. Moore's ongoing snit is a terrifically sustained bit of glowering), but it only barely begins to knit its self-pitying characters into a credible family unit.

On Her Majesty's Secret Service,,61,60,"He's tall, dark, handsome and has a dimpled chin. But Mr. Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement.

The Underneath,Caryn James,69,60,"The Underneath is too chaotic to work as a thriller. The suspense kicks in too late and blends uneasily with the rest of the film.

Cobb,Janet Maslin,66,60,"As a film maker who has his own love-hate romance with the sports world, Mr. Shelton is naturally drawn to his writer's uneasy relationship to Cobb.

Baywatch,A.O. Scott,37,60,"Like its source material, Baywatch is sleazy and wholesome, silly and earnest, dumb as a box of sand and slyly self-aware. It’s soft-serve ice cream. Crinkle-cut fries.

Fever Pitch,Manohla Dargis,56,60,"Still, despite the visual clumsiness and the production's tattered seams, I found myself rooting for this movie anyway, partly because Lindsey and Ben make a nice fit, as do the actors playing them, partly because the Farrellys bring so much heart to their movies, and partly because Ms. Barrymore inspires more goodwill than any other young actress I can think of working today in American movies.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fever-pitch/details

Green Card,Caryn James,58,60,"That understated style at times makes Green Card seem too stiff and vacuous, as if Mr. Weir were inspired by the surface of a Jane Austen work and left out the wicked social observations.

Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,Stephen Holden,58,60,"Unlike those in the book, who speak through e-mails, diaries, letters and interviews, the characters here leave the impression of giving harmless nibbles instead of flesh wounds.

Do Not Resist,Neil Genzlinger,69,60,"The film doesn’t unearth anything that hasn’t already been voiced, and it could use more details on the scope of the phenomenon.

American Made,Manohla Dargis,65,60,"Mr. Cruise’s brisk, ingratiating performance — all smiles, hard-charging physicality and beads of sweat — does a lot to soften the edges.

Lancelot of the Lake,Vincent Canby,74,60,"What's missing from the film is any urgent interior meaning, and this it may be because of the distractions of the exterior details.

Fist Fight,A.O. Scott,37,60,"While I can’t exactly say that the movie cheered me up, it did give me something I needed.

For Greater Glory,Stephen Holden,35,60,"Even at 143 minutes, For Greater Glory cannot satisfyingly fill out the stories of a half-dozen secondary characters, and there are frustrating gaps in the biographies of Gorostieta and José.

Question One,Neil Genzlinger,61,60,"Some viewers will be frustrated by the film's determination to be evenhanded, but with this same battle likely to be fought repeatedly in the coming years (the issue is again on the 2012 Maine ballot), Question One stands as a pretty good primer in how referendums are won and lost.","Oct 18, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/question-one/details

Joe Kidd,,52,60,"For perhaps its first half-hour, John Sturges's new Western, Joe Kidd, looks surprisingly good. It seems restrained, relaxed, unfashionably out of the current mode in its commitment to people and horses rather than to sadistic monsters and machines.

Maleficent,Manohla Dargis,56,60,"Consciously or not, coherently or not, Maleficent tells a new kind of story about how we live now, not once upon another time.

Wild City,Nicolas Rapold,60,60,"The crisscrossing pursuers and pesky police suggest a watered-down version of the treacheries in “City on Fire.” But the cluttered, unfolding dynamism of Mr. Lam’s action scenes remains resilient when gunplay or knife fights are thrust into street life.","Jul 30, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/wild-city/details

White Wash,Rachel Saltz,57,60,"Has a complicated story to tell, about black surfers and, more broadly, about African-American history and the history of surfing.

Tuvalu,Stephen Holden,58,60,"Helmer's wildly whimsical debut film, Tuvalu, is the kind of movie that might one day find itself in the hall of fame of surreal movie weirdness alongside cult favorites like ""Eraserhead,"" ""Delicatessen"" and the avant-garde frolics of Guy Maddin.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tuvalu/details
Pete's Dragon,Janet Maslin,46,60,"At two hours and 14 minutes, the movie is a lot longer than it needs to be.

River of Grass,Stephen Holden,69,60,"It is wonderful at conveying a sense of suffocating ennui. Too wonderful, since the story is so sketchily told and the dialogue is so fragmentary that it doesn't quite cohere.

Silence,Manohla Dargis,79,60,"The film’s solemnity is seductive — as is Mr. Scorsese’s art — especially in light of the triviality and primitiveness of many movies, even if its moments of greatness also make its failures seem more pronounced.","Dec 22, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/silence/details

This Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous,Glenn Kenny,61,60,"Adam Wescott and Scott Fisher, Ms. Lazzarato’s management team, are executive producers for the film, and to a great extent “This Is Everything” seems to follow an agenda set by them in tandem with the movie’s subject, which is largely commendable in its pitch for acceptance and against bigotry.","Feb  2, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/this-is-everything-gigi-gorgeous/details

Al otro lado,Nathan Lee,66,60,"This infectious little movie enriches understanding of the immigrant experience insofar as it translates one of its main forms of expression.

A Walk in the Woods,Manohla Dargis,51,60,"It is unexpectedly moving and occasionally delightful to spend time with these titans of cinema as they walk and sometimes wobble, delivering words that become meaningful because they’re lucky enough to be spoken by Mr. Redford and Mr. Nolte.","Sep  2, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-walk-in-the-woods/details

The Unforeseen,Manohla Dargis,76,60,"There’s nothing wrong with Mr. Redford and his love of nature.

Ants on a Shrimp,Daniel M. Gold,65,60,"None of the concoctions left me salivating (a basic, I’d think, for any food porn), and the exercise seems silly if not decadent.

A Fistful of Dollars,Bosley Crowther,65,60,"Clearly, the magnet of this picture, which has been a phenomenal success in Italy and other parts of Europe, is this cool-cat bandit who is played by Clint Eastwood, an American cowboy actor who used to do the role of rowdy in the Rawhide series on TV.

Brothers ... Blood Against Blood,Rachel Saltz,tbd,60,"Although Brothers is a remake of Gavin O’Connor’s 2011 “Warrior,” its plotting, timeouts for montages and a song or two — Kareena Kapoor appears as a spangly item girl, the sole female in a sea of leering chorus boys — are echt Hindi movie.

Step Up,Jeannette Catsoulis,48,60,"The story is as old as Mickey Rooney but its appeal is eternal, and Step Up cleaves to the template with significantly more rigor than originality.

Electrick Children,Stephen Holden,60,60,"Electrick Children is well acted and refreshingly nonjudgmental, but its narrative continuity is tenuous at best.

The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,Manohla Dargis,56,60,"Mr. Ritchie tends to flaunt his wares like a store clerk, fawning over the clothes, chairs and cars, and his usual rabbity pace slows to a tortoiselike crawl whenever the actors deliver a lot of words, which gratefully isn’t often.

Straight Outta Compton,Manohla Dargis,72,60,"The partying is as bland as any all-purpose music video and feels more like another script signpost (and audience-pandering) than a serious attempt to get out what it means to be young, black, gifted, fabulously wealthy and much desired.

Hello Again,Andy Webster,43,60,"The movie benefits from Austin Schmidt’s neon-infused cinematography and Annie Simeone’s lush production design.

Palmetto,Stephen Holden,43,60,"The film, adapted from a novel by James Hadley Chase, aspires to out-noir every other film noir that has been lumped under that popular term, including ""The Big Sleep"" (which it resembles), in plot trickery and steaminess.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/palmetto/details

Festival in Cannes,Stephen Holden,46,60,"A good deal of anger washes through this acerbic portrait of the movie business in histrionically high gear.

Timecop,Janet Maslin,48,60,"Years of tireless persistence have begun to work in Mr. Van Damme's favor. It's hard not to enjoy his energy, even if his acting gifts still leave a lot to be desired.

Bleak Street,A.O. Scott,62,60,"The film’s enigmas are atmospheric, and somewhat superficial. It solicits the audience’s morbid curiosity rather than gripping our emotions or haunting our dreams.

I Spit on Your Grave,Jeannette Catsoulis,27,60,"Female-empowerment fantasy or just plain prurience, ""Grave"" is extremely efficient grindhouse.

The Harvest,Jeannette Catsoulis,68,60,"There may be little to give you the collywobbles, but there’s quite a lot to enjoy, with Ms. Morton heading the list.

Letters to Father Jaakob,Jeannette Catsoulis,65,60,"Letters transforms a picture-postcard location and odd-couple narrative into a pretty, and pretty predictable, snooze.

Apocalypto,A.O. Scott,68,60,"Neither Mr. Gibson’s fans nor his detractors are likely to accuse him of excessive subtlety, and the effectiveness of Apocalypto is inseparable from its crudity.

The Midwife,Glenn Kenny,66,60,"Because it is a French film, or rather the kind of French film that wants to serve its sentimentality with a dollop of prestige, The Midwife doesn’t offer an entirely shameless version of the “dying free spirit imbues uptight caretaker with a new lust for life” scenario.","Jul 20, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-midwife/details

The Deal,Stephen Holden,46,60,"It's when The Deal leaves the corporate offices behind that the story turns into a bogus, convoluted mess.

Final Destination 2,Dana Stevens,38,60,"Has a ghoulish wit.

Summer in Berlin,Stephen Holden,50,60,"The low-key realism is so meticulously maintained that Summer in Berlin feels somewhat trivial. There is nothing larger here than meets the eye.

Somebody Up There Likes Me,Neil Genzlinger,58,60,"It’s all kind of cute. Maybe a little too cute, but it does have a nice circle-of-life ending.

United Red Army,Manohla Dargis,67,60,"The stilted and awkward physical and vocal performances in combination with the visually flat cinematography bring to mind the look, sound and visual texture of American daytime soaps, an association that perversely makes the movie more and more watchable.","May 27, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/united-red-army/details

Failure to Launch,Stephen Holden,47,60,"The movie has only the most tenuous connection with reality.

Laggies,A.O. Scott,63,60,"This is a nice movie. It’s frisky and cheerful, even when tears are on the way. But it isn’t a very good movie, mainly because, like its heroine, it’s reluctant to make up its mind about what it wants to be.","Oct 23, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/laggies/details

Jiro Dreams of Sushi,Nicolas Rapold,77,60,"Despite foodie-baiting close-ups of nigiri sushi brushed with soy sauce, and montages of skillful food prep, the film falls short as a satisfying exploration of craft.

Skills Like This,Jeannette Catsoulis,44,60,"Drawing much of its energy from an eclectic and fully integrated soundtrack, Skills Like This gazes indulgently on 20-something aimlessness and the comfort of assigned roles.

Ned Kelly,Dana Stevens,56,60,"The storytelling is choppy and abrupt, and the filmmakers rely heavily on voice-over narration to announce themes that are never brought to dramatic life on screen.

The Croods,Neil Genzlinger,55,60,"The movie is at its most interesting and amusing when riffing on how cavemen might have reacted to new experiences and ideas, like fire and shoes.

Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away,A.O. Scott,51,60,"While the bodies of the performers do amazing things, the hectic editing and frequent use of slow motion distract from their physical artistry rather than enhance it.

Monsters University,Manohla Dargis,65,60,"While it’s a visual enchantment (there’s a knockout compendium of horror film clichés), its reversion to a largely male domain after “Brave,” its first and only female-driven story, is a drag.","Jun 20, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/monsters-university/details

Gone Girl,Manohla Dargis,79,60,"At its strongest, Gone Girl plays like a queasily, at times gleefully, funny horror movie about a modern marriage, one that has disintegrated partly because of spiraling downward mobility and lost privilege.

The Fly,Caryn James,79,60,"A film that tries to be too many things at once - funny but not campy, sad and scary, a horror story and a human tragedy",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-fly/details
Citadel,Jeannette Catsoulis,60,60,"This spare first feature from the Irish filmmaker Ciaran Foy (drawing on his own experiences) has an atavistic pulse, evoking a decaying society where elevators fail and bus drivers cower behind mesh grills.","Nov  8, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/citadel/details

Innerspace,Janet Maslin,66,60,"It takes great confidence to think of a second film before the first is even finished; either that, or it takes great nerve.

Elemental,Nicolas Rapold,63,60,"The filmmakers behind Elemental might have done better to commit to a single portrait and been more fearless about avoiding familiar oratory, but small steps are progress too.","May 16, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/elemental/details
Bruce Almighty,Stephen Holden,46,60,"Even more than Jerry Lewis, Robin Williams or Pee-wee Herman, Mr. Carrey, now 41 (pretty old for an overgrown kid), sustains a maniacal energy that explodes off the screen in blinding electrical zaps.

Behind the White Glasses,Ben Kenigsberg,tbd,60,"At its most enjoyable, Valerio Ruiz’s rambling profile cedes the floor to Ms. Wertmüller, who recalls her creative partnership with her husband, the production designer Enrico Job, and her cultural importance in representing Italy’s south onscreen.","Apr 20, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/behind-the-white-glasses/details

Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,Glenn Kenny,49,60,"The movie percolates enough that even when, at its climax, it shamelessly recycles a grisly punch line from 1987’s “RoboCop,” it’s kind of endearing, not least because Mr. Anderson and company make it work.","Jan 26, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/resident-evil-the-final-chapter/details

Marshall,Manohla Dargis,66,60,"Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief.

The Seventh Continent (1989),Caryn James,89,60,"The Seventh Continent is one of the most stylish films in this year's New Directors/New Films series. With its fragmented pattern of beautifully composed and repeated images from middle-class life, it rejuvenates a 1960's style that would seem to be exhausted by now. But the Austrian writer and director Michael Haneke pulls viewers through a good portion of the film on the sheer strength of his visual flair, avoiding the classic trap of how to create a film about boredom that is not boring.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-seventh-continent-1989/details
Napoleon Dynamite,Dana Stevens,64,60,"The performances, even those by trained actors like Mr. Ramirez and Ms. Majorino, have the hesitant, blinking opacity that some directors look for in nonprofessional casts. Their awkwardness is charming, and part of the point of the movie, but it also makes for some dull stretches and thwarts your ability to regard the characters with sympathy rather than mere curiosity.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/napoleon-dynamite/details

Blind Spot. Hitler's Secretary,A.O.

Daughter from Danang,A.O. Scott,77,60,"May not be a great piece of filmmaking, but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice, at least as represented by this case.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/daughter-from-danang/details
In Praise of Love,A.O. Scott,62,60,"Godard's artistry -- the way his scenes are at once archly stylized and informal, the quick precision of his eye -- is unarguable.

Unfriended,Manohla Dargis,59,60,"It reminds you that today’s horror movies still owe a great debt to Val Lewton, the producer of cheapie classics like “Cat People” (1942) and a virtuoso of shadows who realized that audiences could be entertained if the characters they watched looked like them. “Unfriended” doesn’t have Lewton’s poetry. Yet the filmmakers understand that one way into an audience’s head and nervous system is to fill the screen with the kind of “insipidly normal characters” (as the critic Manny Farber described Lewton’s) you’re happy to see shiver and scream.","Apr 16, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/unfriended/details

The Hateful Eight,A.O. Scott,68,60,"Maybe I’m repeating myself: The Hateful Eight is a Quentin Tarantino movie.

The Whistleblower,Stephen Holden,59,60,"For all its high-mindedness, The Whistleblower has a choppy, fumbling screenplay (by Ms. Kondracki and Eilis Kirwan) that lurches between shrill editorializing and vagueness while sorting through more characters than it can comfortably handle or even readily identify.","Aug  4, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-whistleblower/details

My Life as Abraham Lincoln,Andy Webster,tbd,60,"The accessible and appealing Ms. Luft is a strong anchor. And Ms. Berman can be funny (especially with a black-and-white Ingmar Bergman send-up).

Stolen Seas,Jeannette Catsoulis,71,60,"A documentary that yearns to be an adventure movie, Stolen Seas can't resist drowning its invaluable insights in thundering, drum-heavy music and flashing visuals.

The Boss,Manohla Dargis,40,60,"The movie is funny without being much good; mostly, it’s another rung on Ms. McCarthy’s big ladder up. It’s a fitful amalgam of bouncy and slack laughs mixed in with some blasts of pure physical comedy and loads of yammering heads.

Jude,Lawrence Van Gelder,68,60,"With Christopher Eccleston as Jude and Kate Winslet of ''Sense and Sensibility'' as his great love, Sue Bridehead, and with convincing evocations of 19th-century England from locations in Edinburgh and the north of England, Jude remains a handsome if gravely flawed film.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jude/details

Celebrity,Elvis Mitchell,41,60,Ms. Davis gets to deliver the film's obvious message in a single unremarkable line: ''You can tell a lot about a society by who it chooses to celebrate.''

Sky on Fire,Glenn Kenny,45,60,"This is a Hong Kong action picture in the classical mode, balancing mayhem with sentimentality, offering up bone-crunching and jaw-dropping set pieces, and pulling out all the stops for a finale teeming with stressful twists and turnabouts — not to mention kicks, punches, gunshots and explosions.","Dec  1, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sky-on-fire/details
Harry Benson: Shoot First,Neil Genzlinger,74,60,"The film, by Justin Bare and Matthew Miele, would be better if it spent less time gushing about how great Mr. Benson is and more time confronting some of the questions his approach raises.","Dec  8, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/harry-benson-shoot-first/details
Oranges and Sunshine,Stephen Holden,60,60,"Rona Munro's screenplay for Oranges and Sunshine is unnecessarily flighty. As the story ricochets between Britain and Australia, the film often loses track of time and becomes fragmented as it struggles to integrate too many subplots.

Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle,Stephen Holden,64,60,"The chemistry between the two is as old as Abbott and Costello. Harold is the sensible worried one, and Kumar zany and reckless.

Facing Windows,Stephen Holden,55,60,"Despite its surreal touches and an improbable story that piles on the metaphors, the movie, which has a rich, honey-dripping score by Andrea Guerra, maintains a tone of refined heart-tugging realism.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/facing-windows/details
Age of Uprising: The Legend of Michael Kohlhaas,Nicolas Rapold,51,60,"The severely beautiful film is painted in a dauntingly austere manner, as if lost in a war against itself, with confrontations underplayed and the rural landscapes making more of an impression than the detoured drama.","May 29, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/michael-kohlhaas/details

Department Q: The Absent One,Ken Jaworowski,61,60,"The Absent One finds Mr. Kaas as watchable as before, though a few well-intentioned attempts to lighten up his character — an orphaned cat is brought in, a speech about his motivations is given — are clumsily executed, and instead divert from his terse and magnetic personality.","Jun 16, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/department-q-the-absent-one/details

Crimson Peak,A.O. Scott,66,60,"The film is too busy, and in some ways too gross, to sustain an effective atmosphere of dread. It tumbles into pastiche just when it should be swooning and sighing with earnest emotion.","Oct 15, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/crimson-peak/details
Two Lovers and a Bear,Glenn Kenny,61,60,"The beauty and absurdity (things also get harrowing) don’t entirely compensate for the overheated romanticism in which the movie is grounded, but they do make Two Lovers and a Bear a nearly singular cinematic trek.","Dec 15, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/two-lovers-and-a-bear/details

Ip Man: The Final Fight,Nicolas Rapold,55,60,"Seriously, if not always elegantly, the film portrays the great Ip Man as someone trying to survive, which is to say just as often a victim as a victor.","Sep 19, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ip-man-the-final-fight/details
In the Valley of Elah,A.O. Scott,65,60,"However you judge the movie’s politics, and whatever its flaws, there is something inarguable, something irreducibly honest and right, about Mr. Jones’s performance.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-the-valley-of-elah/details
Onmyoji: The Yin Yang Master,Dave Kehr,53,60,"Has the sense of gritty, practical politics of a Japanese samurai epic combined with the high-flying stunt work and magical special effects of a Hong Kong romp.

Brick Mansions,A.O. Scott,40,60,"Brawny, dumb and preposterous, it nonetheless comes tantalizingly close to being a high-impact allegory of race, class and real estate in a postindustrial, new-Gilded Age America.","Apr 24, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/brick-mansions/details

Johnny English Reborn,Stephen Holden,46,60,"As the movie glides along, it may not elicit explosive laughter, but it plants a steady smile on your face and doesn't leave you feeling molested.

The Last Samurai,A.O. Scott,55,60,"Most watchable during the majestic brutality of the battle sequences.

Catfish,A.O. Scott,65,60,"When the going gets weird, Hunter S. Thompson used to say, the weird turn pro, but these filmmakers never transcend their own amateurism.

The Last Exorcism Part II,Andy Webster,35,60,"At least this movie, like its predecessor, has Ashley Bell as Nell.

"If I Want to Whistle, I Whistle",A.O. Scott,64,60,"As the movie becomes more explosive - and more demanding of its cast - it loses some of the quiet, careful intensity that made Silviu's situation worth attending to in the first place.

The Sky Turns,Mike Hale,71,60,The overall effect is one of lulling beauty and immersion in the landscape and culture - certainly enough to carry you through the film - but also an irritating sensation of being led by the nose through Ms. Álvarez's highly aestheticized ruminations.,"Feb 10, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-sky-turns/details

RA. One,Rachel Saltz,60,60,"If the storytelling disappoints (shocking!), the film mostly doesn't. It relies on action and effects and Bollywood's trump card, star power, to carry the day.

What a Girl Wants,Dave Kehr,41,60,"Minnelli's comedy had its serious underpinnings: by the end of the film, a girl had become a woman.

Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu,Rachel Saltz,tbd,60,"The happy surprise of Ek Main aur Ekk Tu a Bollywood romcom that bears a vague resemblance to ""What Happens in Vegas,"" is that it's not crude, sniggering or vindictive.

The Muppets Take Manhattan,Vincent Canby,64,60,"This isn't to say that this particular extravaganza, directed by Frank Oz, is in the same super league as The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper.

The Russian Woodpecker,Nicolas Rapold,74,60,"Whatever the facts, Mr. Gracia’s messily structured film works best as a document of fear in today’s Ukraine and as a kind of ghost story about the Soviet Union.","Oct 15, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-russian-woodpecker/details

Beside Still Waters,Jeannette Catsoulis,42,60,"Bathed in a nostalgic glow that just avoids maudlin, the group’s problems — a sexless marriage, an unexpected job loss — bark but don’t bite.

The Wraith,Janet Maslin,39,60,"Mr. Cassavetes is effectively black-hearted, and makes a striking figure, and Randy Quaid does a lot with the underdeveloped role of a local sheriff.

Sing Me the Songs That Say I Love You: A Concert for Kate McGarrigle,A.O. Scott,61,60,"As a musical experience, it is generous and moving.

A Knight's Tale,Elvis Mitchell,56,60,"The picture itself is good-humored, but bland and predictable. It's a cross between an All-American vaudevillian version of ""Shakespeare in Love"" and Mel Brooks's ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights.""",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-knights-tale/details

Corpo Celeste,Rachel Saltz,65,50,"Ms. Rohrwacher combines a documentary impulse (effective in family scenes) with a more allegorical one.

Backcountry,Manohla Dargis,62,50,"Mr. MacDonald’s ability to notch up dread moment by moment — with a rustle of leaves, the snap of a twig — is all the more impressive given that it takes a while to warm up to the two souls he cuts loose in those woods.","Mar 19, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/backcountry/details

The Human Surge,Glenn Kenny,56,50,"Just when you think you’ve got the movie pegged, it pulls a daring switch of perspective.

Late Bloomers,Stephen Holden,53,50,"As more characters, including the couple's three children - enter the picture, Late Bloomers loses its narrative thread and becomes so choppy that you have the sense that it was butchered during the editing process.

The Fountain,A.O. Scott,51,50,"The problem, though, is that its techniques run too far beyond its ideas, which are blurry and banal, rather than mysterious and resonant.

The Double Life of Veronique,Vincent Canby,86,50,"The Double Life of Veronique doesn't end.

The King's Choice,Ben Kenigsberg,64,50,"The King’s Choice maintains a sense of intrigue when it sticks to the king’s dealings with the government, but the movie drags when it moves outside of back rooms and deviates from setting up the Bräuer-Haakon showdown.","Sep 21, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-kings-choice/details

Shooting Fish,Stephen Holden,47,50,This aggressively whimsical fairy tale about a pair of grown-up orphans who rob from the rich to give to the poor (themselves!) and end up living happily ever after darts forward so quickly that several major plot turns are dispensed with in 10 or 15 seconds of babble.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/shooting-fish/details

A Place at the Table,Jeannette Catsoulis,68,50,"Though the directors, Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush, smartly choose examples from among the working poor — reframing obesity as chronic malnourishment in areas where it’s easier to find a burger than a banana — they’re reluctant to get down in the political dirt.","Feb 28, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-place-at-the-table/details

Piku,Rachel Saltz,tbd,50,"This movie, as the title suggests, is set up to be Piku’s story: How will she make a life? But the filmmakers let Mr. Bachchan overwhelm the story.

Iris,A.O. Scott,76,50,"Rarely does a movie feel as leaden-footed as Iris, especially when it tries to bounce back and forth.

Night Watch: Nochnoi Dozor,Stephen Holden,58,50,"The film may be a mess - narratively muddled and crammed with many more vampires, shape-shifters and sorcerers than one movie can handle, but it bursts with a sick, carnivorous glee in its own fiendish games.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/night-watch-nochnoi-dozor/details

Honor Flight,Neil Genzlinger,61,50,"The film might have made a decent end-of-broadcast segment on a newscast.

Headhunters,Nicolas Rapold,72,50,"As black comedy, the film is crude and downright sloppy when compared with the clockwork machinations of the Coen brothers' creations, as it has been since its premiere.

Finding Mr. Right,David DeWitt,50,50,"Finding Mr. Right (even the title is generic) has a top-to-bottom capable cast, a nice sense of place and a few honest epiphanies that are given time to land.

Beyond the Reach,Neil Genzlinger,34,50,"Any wilderness ordeal has to help some character clarify something, and for Ben it’s his relationship with his girlfriend (Hanna Mangan-Lawrence), which gives the film a modest side interest.

Blow,Dana Stevens,52,50,"Depp's witty, spare performance gives the picture a poignancy -- a depth of feeling, if you'll allow the pun -- that Mr. Demme's hectic direction and the hurried script by David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes don't quite earn.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blow/details

Thor,A.O. Scott,57,50,"The absolute and unbroken mediocrity of Thor is evidence of its success. This movie is not distinctively bad, it is axiomatically bad. And THAT is depressing.

In the Heart of the Sea,Manohla Dargis,47,50,"As the movie lurches along by fits and starts, toggling between the little Nantucket room and the great watery world, it becomes apparent that the filmmakers have no idea how to reconcile not just two parallel stories but also the past and our contemporary age.","Dec 10, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-the-heart-of-the-sea/details
Ride Along 2,A.O. Scott,32,50,"This franchise is lucky to have Kevin Hart in that role, and his manic comic energy is enough to make the sequel something other than a complete waste of time.

Youth,A.O. Scott,64,50,"The problem with Youth is not that it’s empty — the accusation Kael and others lodged against Mr. Sorrentino’s precursors — but that it’s small.

The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,Manohla Dargis,68,50,"Mr. Pitt is himself a supernova luminary, of course, and part of the attraction of this film is how his celebrity feeds into that of his character, adding shadings to what is, finally, an overconceptualized if under-intellectualized endeavor.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford/details
Beowulf,Manohla Dargis,59,50,"The 3-D is necessary to the film only in so far as it keeps your eyes engaged when your mind starts to wander. Stripped of much of the original poem’s language, its cadences, deep history and context, this film version of Beowulf doesn’t offer much beyond 3-D oohs and ahs, sword clanging and a nicely conceived dragon, which probably explains why Mr. Zemeckis and his collaborators have tried to sex it up with Ms. Jolie, among other comic-book flourishes.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/beowulf/details
Vivere,Jeannette Catsoulis,50,50,"Almost holding things together is the marvelous Ms. Elsner: there’s more depth in her weary gaze and disappointed mouth than in any line of dialogue.

Garden Party,Stephen Holden,31,50,"Whatever else it may accomplish, Garden Party, which is clumsily structured but well acted, with pungently realistic dialogue, puts you in a world without a center in which you can't tell upside down from right-side up.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/garden-party/details
Doubt,Manohla Dargis,68,50,"Mainstream moviemaking, with its commercial directives and slavish attachment to narrative codes isn't particularly hospitable to ambiguity...which may help explain why Mr. Shanley's film feels caught between two mediums and why Ms. Streep appears to be in a Gothic horror thriller while everyone else looks and sounds closer to life or at least dramatic realism.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/doubt/details
Compadres,Neil Genzlinger,28,50,"Compadres tries to be a lighthearted cross-border buddy film, and sometimes it succeeds.

Natural Selection,Stephen Holden,57,50,"Aside from Ms. Harris's performance, the main reason to recommend Natural Selection - very conditionally - is that its creator clearly has talent.

Dark Star,Janet Maslin,66,50,"There are some funny routines here, though Mr. Carpenter doesn't seem to have cared much about integrating or sustaining them. Mr. Carpenter makes his amateurishness unmistakable, especially when it comes to the film's four actors. Only one of them can act even crudely (fortunately, his is the largest role).

For No Good Reason,A.O. Scott,56,50,For No Good Reason is less revealing than a standard hourlong television tribute might have been...

Devil's Knot,Stephen Holden,42,50,"In the opening images of Devil’s Knot, the camera sets a menacing, Hitchcockian mood by stealthily creeping into the woods where the murders took place.

Orange Winter,,40,50,"Orange Winter is more than a mere history lesson.

Rio 2,Jeannette Catsoulis,49,50,"A tropical tornado of cadmium and cobalt, magenta and marigold, Carlos Saldanha’s frantic follow-up to his well-received 2011 animated feature, “Rio,” ups the ante on sound and movement but pays scant attention to story.","Apr 10, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rio-2/details

The FP,Andy Webster,48,50,"The film has an effective synthesizer score by George Holdcroft.

Remote Area Medical,Neil Genzlinger,71,50,"Remote Area Medical, a documentary about the nonprofit organization of that name, certainly shows you what they look like, in blunt, tooth-decaying detail.

Dirty Weekend,Nicolas Rapold,39,50,"What’s most curious is Mr. Labute’s kid-glove treatment of the scenario, forgoing real sexual gamesmanship, much less the opportunistic rug-pulling in past films. That baseline of sincerity is refreshing to a point, yet he’s written a fairly weak-tea story of conflicted self-discovery that would make for a mildly engaging evening on the stage.","Sep  3, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-weekend/details
Ghosts of Cité Soleil,A.O.

Last Knights,Manohla Dargis,27,50,"Its cast aside, Last Knights proves as square and blandly manly as an old “Prince Valiant” comic strip.

Can't Buy Me Love,Caryn James,36,50,"Can't Buy Me Love has an identity crisis that's a mirror-image of Ronald's own. He thinks he wants popularity at any price, though he's really a sincere guy.

Hellbound?,Neil Genzlinger,53,50,"Mr. Miller makes a questionable choice in setting the film against the backdrop of the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11, and he lingers too long on an offensive fringe group that hangs out near ground zero with signs saying the terrorist attacks were God's will.

Miral,A.O. Scott,45,50,"To say that Mr. Schnabel's film is innocuous is not to say that it's any good.

Eraser,Elvis Mitchell,56,50,"Eraser means to show off the star's standard persona against a backdrop of lavish special effects, which is certainly a formula that's worked before.

Flyboys,Nathan Lee,47,50,"Despite its empty head and arduous length, Flyboys is ever so nice, in the manner of a Norman Rockwell illustration.

All I See Is You,Jeannette Catsoulis,43,50,"The director, Marc Forster (who wrote the script with Sean Conway), fashions such a languid, tipsy aesthetic around the seemingly happy marriage of Gina and James (Blake Lively and Jason Clarke) that it’s easy to keep watching.","Oct 26, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-i-see-is-you/details
Reign Over Me,A.O. Scott,61,50,"Reign Over Me uses the rhythms and moods of comedy to explore, and also to contain, overpowering feelings of loss, anger and hurt.

Ardor,Daniel M. Gold,48,50,"This slow-paced, cut-to-the-bone drama ought to be gripping, especially as the jungle and its beasts make their presence felt.

Welcome to the Machine,Nicolas Rapold,tbd,50,"A strain of quixotic eccentricity runs through the film's endeavor; Mr. Weider basically has more material than he can marshal.

Haywire,A.O. Scott,67,50,"Once the talking stops and the action begins, her professionalism is very much in evidence and exciting to watch.

Rob the Mob,Jeannette Catsoulis,63,50,"Vividly painting Queens in the early 1990s as a landscape of crack and graffiti, the filmmakers go on to smother any menace with a swoony-upbeat soundtrack and an “oh, those kooky kids” tone.","Mar 20, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rob-the-mob/details

Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,A.O. Scott,43,50,"This movie incites curiosity tinged with confusion and irritation.

Two Weeks,Stephen Holden,44,50,"Two Weeks gets into serious trouble in its clumsy attempts to offset the sadness and anxiety with humor.

Butter,Jeannette Catsoulis,40,50,Well acted and sporadically amusing - especially when Olivia Wilde's profanity-spewing stripper is around - Butter alternates between looking down its nose at Midwestern passions and cooing over smugly liberal values.,"Oct  4, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/butter/details
The Other Guys,A.O. Scott,64,50,"Raises expectations that it has no real inclination to fulfill.

Amen.,Dana Stevens,57,50,"In the end Amen is neither as moving nor as illuminating as it should be.

Reversion,Neil Genzlinger,46,50,"The film does a pretty good job of conveying the bleakness and pointlessness Eva and her fellow mutants feel, but it's as if Ms. Trachinger were reluctant to take the premise any deeper for fear of being accused of imitating ""Memento"" or ""Groundhog Day"" or any number of other trapped-in-time films.","Jun  9, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/reversion/details

Just 45 Minutes from Broadway,David DeWitt,31,50,"Partly reverent, mostly sendup, Just 45 Minutes From Broadway depicts theater folk as those lovably quirky people who can't stop performing in life, for better or worse.

Baby Mama,Manohla Dargis,55,50,"The film never comes fully to term, as it were: the visual style is sitcom functional, and even the zippiest jokes fall flat because of poor timing.

Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America,Manohla Dargis,51,50,Though there's no doubt that Mr. Stone is as serious as a heart attack when it comes to creating an air of authenticity -- hence the sloppily butchered chickens and authorial defecation -- he never settles on a coherent tone for the movie.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/severed-ways-the-norse-discovery-of-america/details

Murder of a Cat,Neil Genzlinger,31,50,"The film, a first feature from Gillian Greene (wife of the director Sam Raimi, a producer here), has to settle for “sometimes amusing comedy” when it was probably aiming for “cult hit.”","Dec  4, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/murder-of-a-cat/details

Jeepers Creepers II,Dave Kehr,36,50,"You don't have to be a horror-movie scholar to know that nothing significant is going to happen in any movie with ""2"" in the title; the creature has to stay around long enough at least to complete a trilogy and fill out a nice boxed set of DVD's.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jeepers-creepers-ii/details
The Pact 2,Andy Webster,37,50,"The directors, Dallas Hallam and Patrick Horvath, are fluent in the genre’s staples (creaky interiors, slamming doors, yada yada yada), lighting schemes and startling edits.

Rock in the Red Zone,Ken Jaworowski,54,50,"Rock in the Red Zone has its best moments when it explores the anxiety of Sderot’s residents and their endurance.

Take Care,Andy Webster,34,50,"The film’s director, Liz Tuccillo — a former writer for “Sex and the City,” an author of “He’s Just Not That Into You” and now developing a sitcom for Lauren Graham — is predictably facile with comic rhythms, though her dialogue tilts toward the glib, and her characterizations toward the familiar.","Dec  4, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/take-care/details

Yes Nurse!

Magical Universe,Nicolas Rapold,60,50,"While Mr. Workman evidently respects Mr. Carbee’s talent, he also frames his movie as a trite narrative about a kind of lovably odd acquaintance who comes out of his shell, without many incisive ideas about shaping or broadening the material.","Oct 30, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/magical-universe/details
Becoming Jane,Stephen Holden,55,50,The screenplay’s pseudo-Austen tone is so consistent that its lapses into modern romance-novel fantasy threaten to derail the film.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/becoming-jane/details
Freshman Orientation,Jeannette Catsoulis,41,50,"On one level, a stereotypical mash of Greek cruelty, queer poetry slams and rabid activist rhetoric.

Farewell to Hollywood,Ben Kenigsberg,63,50,"Farewell to Hollywood is moving yet queasily unsettling, even if Ms. Nicholson’s enthusiasm mitigates the veneer of exploitation.

Turbo,A.O. Scott,58,50,"It is interesting to note that a movie strenuously preaching the virtue of being different should be so fundamentally — so deliberately, so timidly — just like everything else of its kind...

Donkey Punch,Stephen Holden,43,50,"Until it plunges into gore, the movie remains above the typical splatter 'n' scream fest.

Fanboys,Neil Genzlinger,45,50,"There are enough good jokes in Fanboys, a road comedy about geeks on a ""Star Wars""-related quest, to satisfy hard-core fans of that George Lucas franchise.

Jupiter Ascending,Manohla Dargis,40,50,"With its nods to the original “Star Trek” and David Lynch’s proto-steampunk hallucination “Dune,” it seduces the eye with filigreed flourishes even as the mind reels from some of the mildewy storytelling.","Feb  5, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jupiter-ascending/details

Backdraft,Elvis Mitchell,38,50,"While Mr. Howard ably maintains a strong forward momentum, Backdraft often feels directionless beneath its overlay of frantic activity. One clear story line would have been worth more than a series of subplots and tangents.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/backdraft/details
Chronicles,Stephen Holden,63,50,"A film divided against itself. The more the cat-and-mouse game between prisoner and reporter points it in the direction of ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" the closer it inches toward the sort of exploitation it condemns; for me, that's too close for Crónicas to be taken without a big grain of salt.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/chronicles/details

The Circle,Glenn Kenny,43,50,"The novel is at its most trenchantly funny when depicting the exhausting nature of virtual social life, and it’s in this area, too, that the movie gets its very few knowing laughs.

Mercy,Stephen Holden,46,50,"Had John Cassavetes directed “Love Story,” it might have turned out looking and sounding something like Mercy, a portrait of a sub-Mailer-like literary pugilist and the woman (named Mercy) who wins his heart. Odd as that juxtaposition may seem, it’s not a bad mix.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mercy/details
The Reagan Show,A.O. Scott,66,50,"Reagan’s legacy remains a live and contentious issue. His name is still routinely invoked, on the left and the right, with reverence and rage.

Texas Chainsaw 3D,Andy Webster,31,50,"Ms. Daddario is adequate, while Mr. Eastwood, as a lawman, strikes sinister notes.

Loosies,Manohla Dargis,35,50,"There are a couple of movies, or rather a couple of story ideas, tucked in Loosies, an amorphous, laugh-flecked drama about a New York City pickpocket that mostly comes across as a feature-length advertisement for its likable star and writer, Peter Facinelli.","Jan 12, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/loosies/details

CB4,Janet Maslin,49,50,"Made in the shadow of Wayne's World, CB4 is another Saturday Night Live-related music parody, this time skewering rap instead of heavy metal.

Otoshimono,,tbd,50,"The movie ultimately proves more unnerving than terrifying, and the monster, which probably shouldn't have been revealed in quite so much detail, looks too much like the title character of ""Bride of Chucky,"" only with eyes in the back of her mossy head.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/otoshimono/details

Where God Left His Shoes,Stephen Holden,61,50,"Although Mr. Leguizamo wisely underplays a role that is just short of saintly, the character is still a filmmaker's bogus, bleeding-heart contrivance in a movie that is much less truthful than it pretends to be.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/where-god-left-his-shoes/details

A Little Chaos,Stephen Holden,51,50,"Mr. Schoenaerts’s dour André may make conceptual sense, but he leaves a hole in this handsomely mounted costume drama that would have profited from more intrigue and a steamier erotic atmosphere.","Jun 25, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-little-chaos/details
Coherence,Manohla Dargis,65,50,"At some point, though, Mr. Byrkit turns one too many corners (characters, meanwhile, begin bustling in and out of rooms like Marx Brothers extras), and what began as a nifty puzzle feels more like a trap.","Jun 19, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/coherence/details

Outside the Law,Stephen Holden,59,50,"As powerful and well made as it is, Outside the Law is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic.

The Juche Idea,Mike Hale,55,50,"The Juche Idea is meant to be a comedy, one that cuts two ways: mocking the strictures placed on moviemakers in both Communist and capitalist systems.

Straw Dogs,A.O. Scott,45,50,"Mr. Lurie's movie does not quite succeed on its own, though it is pulpy and brutal and at times grotesquely comical.

Footloose,A.O. Scott,58,50,"Somehow Footloose never finds its rhythm. The maudlin scenes drag on, and the livelier moments pass by too quickly. It only works when it settles down and lets the characters (and the audience) hang out and have a little fun.","Oct 13, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/footloose/details
Blindness,A.O. Scott,45,50,"Not a great film, mainly because it can't transcend -- and, indeed, lays bare -- the intellectual flimsiness of its source. But it is, nonetheless, full of examples of what good filmmaking looks like. For all its chin-rubbing, brow-furrowing attitudes, it does not, in the end, give you much to think about. But there is, nonetheless, a lot here to see.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blindness/details

Teddy Bears' Picnic,Dave Kehr,32,50,Fitfully entertaining molehill of a movie.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/teddy-bears-picnic/details
Getting Straight,,58,50,"A brilliant, mercurial performance by Elliott Gould steadies and vivifies but cannot save Getting Straight. Even with such sideline brilliance as the sad-funny performance of young Robert F. Lyons almost matching Gould's, the picture ends as a cop-out of its own professed principles and initial honesty.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/getting-straight/details
Restless,A.O. Scott,47,50,"It is hard to say, though, if this film, directed by Gus Van Sant from a script by Jason Lew, is an argument for denial or a treatise on acceptance. Curiously, and in a way that is sometimes touching and sometimes icky, it does not seem to perceive much of a difference.","Sep 15, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/restless-2011/details
Ip Man 3,Andy Webster,57,50,"Despite Mr. Yen’s impressive physical virtuosity, his stoic, often humorless presence tends to neutralize the emotional temperature.","Jan 21, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ip-man-3/details
Never Let Me Go,Manohla Dargis,69,50,"Alas, what's missing is the spark of life, the jolt of the unexpected - something beyond tears - to puncture the falseness of a film world, which, by its insistence on its own beauty, obscures the tragedy that the three characters, by their nature, cannot express.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/never-let-me-go/details

Take Me Home Tonight,Stephen Holden,42,50,"What keeps the movie, directed by Michael Dowse, on a more or less even keel is its steady pacing and emotional kinship to John Hughes comedies like ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club.""","Mar  4, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/take-me-home-tonight/details

The Emperor's Club,Dana Stevens,49,50,"Carefully sets itself up as an obvious, transparent morality play, and then just as deliberately refuses the easy payoff. This is both impressive and a little disingenuous: the film is in effect congratulating itself for refusing to offer a neat and tidy view of life without offering much else.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-emperors-club/details
The Big Bounce,Dana Stevens,42,50,"The usual double-crosses and convolutions ensue, but the narrative is so haphazard that the whole thing -- both the caper and the movie that contains it -- seems to have been hastily improvised.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-big-bounce/details
Snatched,A.O. Scott,45,50,"Though this movie ostensibly celebrates the spirit of adventure and openness to experience, it takes no risks and blazes no trails.

Freedom,Andy Webster,30,50,"Freedom does not remotely approach, say, “12 Years a Slave” in its production values or dramatic impact.

Una,Glenn Kenny,62,50,"The scenes that leave Ms. Mara and Mr. Mendelsohn alone are, tellingly, the most interesting and effective ones.

Black Mass,A.O. Scott,68,50,"Mr. Cooper’s direction is skillful, if overly reliant on borrowed Scorseseisms (especially when it comes to music), and the cast is first-rate, but the film is a muddle of secondhand attitudes and half-baked ideas.

My Afternoons with Margueritte,Rachel Saltz,59,50,"The fine-boned, delicate-looking Ms. Casadesus, now 97, is a pleasure to watch.

Hop,A.O. Scott,41,50,"Hop is innocuous, though occasionally annoying and also, less expectedly, occasionally funny.

Herb & Dorothy 50X50,Miriam Bale,65,50,"It’s difficult to dislike a documentary with such noble, generous subjects, but the film is unfocused and repetitious, not sure whether it is a road trip, a story of a couple or an exploration of small art institutions.","Sep 12, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/herb-dorothy-50x50/details
Rocky III,Vincent Canby,57,50,"It's not giving away state secrets to report that Rocky finds that success has made him fat and that to triumph again, he has to learn to be ''hungry.''

One Bright Shining Moment,Janet Maslin,64,50,"Still, as the documentary plods past the two-hour mark, much of Mr. McGovern's legend seems dependent on Nixon's faults, and even the Democrat's political supporters, with hindsight's many gifts, can't infuse his persona with any more dynamism.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/one-bright-shining-moment/details

The Awakening,Stephen Holden,53,50,"Most of the supernatural sightings are flickers at the corners of the screen, so that at certain moments watching the movie feels like taking an eye exam.

The Hottest State,Stephen Holden,45,50,"At around the halfway point, its characters’ haranguing voices begin to grate on you.

Captain Ron,Vincent Canby,39,50,"The scenery is pretty but the movie never makes one wish to be in it.

Seaside,A.O. Scott,66,50,"While she (Lopes-Curval) portrays the brittleness of their lives with lovely splashes of generosity, the lack of condescension doesn't change the fact that there's not much drama to be found in those very limitations; her characters don't do much beyond getting on one another's nerves.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/seaside/details

Spartacus,Bosley Crowther,87,50,"It is a spotty, uneven drama in which the entire opening phase representing the basic-training program in a gladiatorial school is lively, exciting and expressive, no matter how true to history it is, and the middle phase is pretentious and tedious, because it is concerned with the dull strife of politics.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/spartacus/details

Nine 1/2 Weeks,Vincent Canby,50,50,"In 9 1/2 Weeks, he has created a work that might well qualify as a truly nouveau film.

The Alphabet Killer,Jeannette Catsoulis,tbd,50,Relies less on the novelty of its premise than on the positioning of solid actors in minor roles (including Melissa Leo and Martin Donovan as the tortured parents of a murdered child) and the intelligence of its star.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-alphabet-killer/details

Camelot,Bosley Crowther,70,50,"What it basically needed in its transfer to the screen was a drenching in cinema magic to remove all the dull and pretentious patches of realism and romantic cliché that kept it from sparkling in the theater.

Pray for Japan,Jeannette Catsoulis,53,50,"If making a decent movie required only good intentions, then Pray for Japan would be off and running. As it is, though, this muddled collage of random impressions and personal histories, emerging from last year's destruction of the Tohoku coastline by the earthquake and tsunami, doesn't document a tragedy so much as repeat a mantra.","Mar 16, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pray-for-japan/details

Salvation Boulevard,A.O. Scott,35,50,"As the plot swerves toward an almost crazy conclusion, there is the inkling of a strong, interesting idea here, about how some versions of modern religion are predicated on the systematic denial of reality, but Salvation Boulevard is itself too loosely tethered to the actual world to make the point with the necessary vigor or acuity.","Jul 14, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/salvation-boulevard/details
A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,Caryn James,56,50,"Elm Street 4' does have an endless onslaught of astonishing, often grotesque special effects .Mr. Harlin only has to keep things moving, which he does with restless camera work, swirling high above Freddy and his victims.

Assassination Tango,Stephen Holden,51,50,"If Mr. Duvall's finely textured performance is a testament to the power of good screen acting to lift a film above the mundane, the movie's many irritating tics demonstrate that he is much more at home in front of the camera than behind it.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/assassination-tango/details
Exists,Jeannette Catsoulis,22,50,"Featuring the usual fractured visuals, generic victims and pinballing cameras — both hand-held and mounted on bike helmets — Exists nevertheless has an unusually dreamy opening and a few surprisingly entertaining tweaks.","Oct 23, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/exists/details
Live by Night,Manohla Dargis,49,50,"Live by Night is a messy, unfocused movie about ambition, lost ideals, corrupt men and a thief whose idea of life on his own terms means pulling the trigger.","Dec 22, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/live-by-night/details

Vice,Andy Webster,55,50,"Raul Sanchez Inglis directed, but Mr. Tarantino's influence prevails, in the cinematography by Andrzej Sekula of ""Dogs""; in the abundant epithets and expletives; and in the climactic ""Dogs""-style standoff.

Mighty Joe Young,Stephen Holden,51,50,"Mighty Joe Young, directed by Ron Underwood from a screenplay by Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner, is saddled with dialogue so wooden that Mr. Paxton and Ms. Theron almost seem animatronic themselves.

The Uninvited,A.O. Scott,43,50,"The main problem with The Uninvited lies in its refusal to decide just what movie it wants to be a commercial for.

Thief,Vincent Canby,78,50,"Mr. Mann may well become a very good theatrical film maker but, among other things, he's going to have to learn how to edit himself, to resist the temptation to allow dialogue that is colorful to turn, all of a sudden, into deep, abiding purple.

What's the Matter with Kansas?,Andy Webster,56,50,"The specific roots of a pervasive sense of disenfranchisement are barely described, as are strategies for liberals seeking to reclaim the state.

Cirkus Columbia,Stephen Holden,57,50,"Half of the time, the movie - based on a novel by Ivica Dikic, who collaborated with Mr. Tanovic on the screenplay - has the tone and pace of a farce.

Amnesia,Manohla Dargis,59,50,"Amnesia, Mr. Schroeder has said, is a story partly based on his mother, who refused to speak German, so perhaps it’s no surprise that it’s strongest when it focuses on Martha, a character Ms. Keller inhabits gracefully.","Jul 20, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/amnesia-2015/details

Bends,Nicolas Rapold,tbd,50,"Shot in sleek tones by Christopher Doyle, the film melds class-conscious melodrama with malleable mood piece, but keeps threatening to fade from understatement into stasis.","Apr 23, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bends/details
Oldboy,Manohla Dargis,74,50,"Entertaining to watch - notwithstanding the scene in which Dae-su eats a live animal - which is a good thing, because there is not much to think about here, outside of the choreographed mayhem.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/oldboy/details

Aurora Borealis,Nathan Lee,58,50,"The fixation of independent movies on the arrested development of bourgeois dullards may have less to do with the relevance of the topic than the class of people who get to make movies.

The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Her,Manohla Dargis,67,50,"Although the novelty of this repetition and Mr. Benson’s adjustments pull you in like a new puzzle, his actual ideas — about people, their stories and how to tell those stories — turn out to be fairly straight.","Oct  9, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-disappearance-of-eleanor-rigby-her/details
Conviction,A.O. Scott,61,50,"It would be easy to dismiss Conviction on the ground that it plays like a made-for-television movie, but the truth is that, as often as not, movies made for the small screen are better than this: braver, darker, more willing to explore odd corners of feeling.","Oct 21, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/conviction/details
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,Dave Kehr,40,50,"A programmer that once upon a time would have played on the bottom half of double bills, Anacondas has no pretensions and gets its little job done effectively, providing some small-scale laughs and chills for the late summer season.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/anacondas-the-hunt-for-the-blood-orchid/details
Moscow Never Sleeps,Ben Kenigsberg,51,50,"Absent fathers and mothers, building bridges with children — Moscow Never Sleeps could easily have unfolded in a much darker register.

The Libertine,Manohla Dargis,44,50,"The rhythms of the dialogue move to the same beat as steadily as a metronome ticks and tocks, while every sentence is polished like stone, absent the jaggedness of real breath and life.

Lamb,Manohla Dargis,62,50,"Mr. Partridge never figures out how to complicate his version and its voices, or maybe doesn’t want to.

The Natural,Vincent Canby,61,50,"Mr. Levinson, who both wrote and directed Diner, the small, exquisitely realized comedy about growing up aimless in Baltimore, here seems to be at the service of other people's decisions.

Into the Forest,Manohla Dargis,59,50,Ms. Rozema tries to build tension and sustain interest by thickening the atmosphere and layering on details rather than big incidents.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,Vincent Canby,81,50,"The Empire Strikes Back is not a truly terrible movie. It's a nice movie. It's not, by any means, as nice as ""Star Wars.""

Being Flynn,A.O. Scott,53,50,"There is honest feeling, genuine humanity and real intelligence in this movie, but there is also a sense of caution, of indecisiveness, that undermines its potential power.

Seed of Chucky,Anita Gates,46,50,Most of the humor falls flat. One of the film's little joys is John Waters in a small part as a sleazy photographer who ends up having his face melted off with sulfuric acid.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/seed-of-chucky/details

Surrogate Valentine,David DeWitt,53,50,"But the story never asserts itself in any dramatic or comedic or even home-movie fashion. It turns on whether the dopey actor can coax the quiet musician out of his shell (not much) and if the quiet musician can connect with his high school crush (I'll say no more, as that's the only suspense).","Sep 29, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/surrogate-valentine/details
The Ten,Jeannette Catsoulis,50,50,"A “Decalogue” for special-ed students, The Ten leans too often toward the bizarre and the bewildering. And though rough sex is a recurring motif, the movie’s overall tone is less blasphemous than raunchy.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ten/details
Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights - Hollywood to the Heartland,Stephen Holden,51,50,"Though it includes some moderately funny snippets of actual performances, Wild West Comedy Show is not a concert film.

20 Once Again,Nicolas Rapold,tbd,50,"Mining deeper emotions from the fanciful premise doesn’t work out for the film, which gets tied down to a generic musical-contest subplot.

The Jungle Book,Manohla Dargis,77,50,"While this The Jungle Book is lightly diverting, it is also disappointing, partly because it feels like a pumped-up version of Disney’s 1967 animated film, with more action and less sweetness.

Dogtooth,A.O. Scott,73,50,Dogtooth supplies no such explanation and at times seems as much an exercise in perversity as an examination of it.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dogtooth/details
School Daze,Janet Maslin,49,50,"Neither this anger nor Mr. Lee's daring is ever given free rein. Instead of a sharp satire or even an ""Animal House"" variation (since fraternity life is central to its story), School Daze is a collection of musical numbers, dramatic episodes, attempts at parody and cinematic wild cards, bound together only loosely by Mr. Lee's prevailing sense of outrage.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/school-daze/details
"K'na, the Dreamweaver",Helen T.

Rocky II,Janet Maslin,61,50,"Rocky II has a waxy feeling, and it never comes to life the way its predecessor did. As the characters go through their stock routines — Talia Shire shyly whispering I love you, Mr. Stallone making self-deprecating jokes, Burgess Meredith telling the kid he's either a bum or a hero — you get the feeling that you've been here before. Well, you have.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rocky-ii/details

Gloomy Sunday,Stephen Holden,60,50,The story is so schematically histrionic that the bringing in of the Holocaust late in the day feels exploitative and unearned. Gloomy Sunday is an oddity that takes itself much too seriously.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gloomy-sunday/details
Down Terrace,Stephen Holden,68,50,"However persuasively acted, this mélange of cinéma vérité, slapstick and murder - whose story has a lot in common with the recent Australian gangster film ""Animal Kingdom"" - has too many narrative gaps for its pieces to cohere satisfactorily.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/down-terrace/details

The Bang Bang Club,Jeannette Catsoulis,48,50,"Why, then, do we care not one bit when Pulitzers are won and bullets unsuccessfully dodged?

Prom Night,Vincent Canby,45,50,"Prom Night is a comparatively genteel hybrid, part shock melodrama, like Halloween, and part mystery, though it's less a whodunit than a who's-doing-it.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/prom-night-1980/details
X-Men: The Last Stand,Manohla Dargis,58,50,"Mostly, as so often with these types of empty entertainments, you are left to wonder why companies that hire so many fine actors to run around under latex and foam and have the best technological wizardry money can buy seem to spend so little attention to the screenplay.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/x-men-the-last-stand/details

Dunston Checks In,Stephen Holden,54,50,"The movie should have been a steadily escalating rampage that results in outrageous property damage.

Can We Take a Joke?,Neil Genzlinger,49,50,"The documentary Can We Take a Joke?, a one-sided look at a multisided issue, does a fine job of defending a comic’s right to perform incendiary material.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,Manohla Dargis,76,50,"Though Ms. Rapace is a fine professional scowler, with cheekbones that thrust like knives and a pout that’s mostly pucker, she tends to register as an intriguing idea instead of a thoroughly realized character.

England Is Mine,Jeannette Catsoulis,45,50,"With its bleak, yearning tone and defiantly cloudy color palette, “England Is Mine” has a pleasingly granular feel for its era and location.

Impolex,A.O. Scott,32,50,"Mr. Perry, a New York University graduate whose second feature, ""The Color Wheel,"" provoked passion and puzzlement at several festivals, has a natural eye, an offbeat sense of rhythm and no great interest in conventional storytelling.

In a Valley of Violence,Jeannette Catsoulis,64,50,"Mr. West retains his signature restraint and slow-burn approach to brutality.

Kindergarten Cop,Caryn James,61,50,"No one laughs at Arnold Schwarzenegger better than Arnold Schwarzenegger himself.

Heartbreaker,Stephen Holden,59,50,"Yes, Heartbreaker is diverting, intermittently charming and occasionally funny, but it is also a jumble of jammed-together notions.

The Sitter,Manohla Dargis,39,50,"Some of it, though, is absurdly comic, like the shot of a guy on a Segway that exists for no reason other than that someone here thought the movie could use a small laugh right then.

City Slickers,Janet Maslin,70,50,"A comedy that's cheery, earnest, harmless and almost totally lacking in bite.

Jarhead,Dana Stevens,58,50,"Mr. Swofford's book has earned a place alongside the classics of military literature, but Mr. Mendes's film is more like a footnote - a minor movie about a minor war, and a film that feels, at the moment, remarkably irrelevant.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jarhead/details

Phantasm II,Caryn James,42,50,"There are some grotesquely stylish and scary moments in Phantasm II, the sequel to a 1979 film that Don Coscarelli made as a precocious 25-year-old.

Hey Arnold! The Movie,A.O. Scott,47,50,"Blown up way past television-set size, the animated film's squiggly lines and rushed renditions are pale and blurry.

1492: Conquest of Paradise,Vincent Canby,47,50,"1492 is not a terrible film. Yet because it is without any guiding point of view, it is a lot less interesting than the elaborate physical production that has been given it. Only a very great writer could do justice to all the themes the Columbus story suggests. Ms. Bosch may be a very good researcher, but she's not a very great writer.

Ezra,Stephen Holden,56,50,"The movie’s sense of time is as vague as Ezra’s perception of it. Chaos is all he knows.

Flightplan,Manohla Dargis,53,50,"To watch Ms. Foster storm through a phony airplane for an entire movie has its very minor pleasures - given the numerous close-ups, you can study her lovely face at your leisure - but there is nothing here to feed the head or fray the nerves.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/flightplan/details
The Serpent and the Rainbow,Janet Maslin,64,50,"Mr. Craven's attempts at such effects are always gripping, but here they are sometimes overpowered by the complexity of the material.

5 Days of War,Stephen Holden,31,50,"The movie is a continuous barrage of explosions, sneak attacks, chases, life-and-death face-offs, and amazing rescues that are as far-fetched as they are exhilarating.

Outbreak,Janet Maslin,65,50,"The effort to turn Outbreak into an action picture insures that little of it will be believable, regardless of how much scientific data has been woven into the story.

Hot Tub Time Machine 2,Stephen Holden,29,50,"Whether something did or didn’t happen, and the comic confusion as the future bumps into the past: those are the smart parts of a movie that is not as idiotic as it pretends to be.","Feb 19, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hot-tub-time-machine-2/details

Moscow on the Hudson,Vincent Canby,67,50,"It seems unfinished, not yet thought through. Even the title doesn't quite fit, since the New York City that Vladimir discovers is far more densely populated by Southern blacks, Latin Americans, Western Europeans, Orientals and Indians from India than by Russians.

Because I Said So,A.O. Scott,26,50,"A mild exercise in deliberate mediocrity, with chuckles and heartwarming moments distributed as carefully as nuts in a factory-made brownie.

Porto,Jeannette Catsoulis,50,50,"This first narrative feature from Gabe Klinger seduces with breathtakingly gorgeous visuals that feel both achingly nostalgic and elegantly modern.

Memoirs of a Geisha,Manohla Dargis,54,50,"Mr. Marshall can't rescue the film from its embarrassing screenplay or its awkward Chinese-Japanese-Hollywood culture klatch, but Memoirs of a Geisha is one of those bad Hollywood films that by virtue of their production values nonetheless afford a few dividends, in this case, fabulous clothes and three eminently watchable female leads.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/memoirs-of-a-geisha/details
Tammy,Manohla Dargis,39,50,"Tammy’s journey, as they like to say in movieland, is into self-worth.

Shit Year,Manohla Dargis,50,50,"Shot in handsome, often vividly contrasting black and white, ""____ Year"" weighs in as an attempt at poetic expressionism, a bid to create a visual representation of Colleen's diffuse and fragmented mind. Mr. Archer's narrative ambitions are laudable, and some of his images (the cinematographer is Aaron Platt) are striking, though a lot of scenes also look like glossy fashion magazine layouts come to relative life. These poses and pretty rooms may accurately reflect Colleen's visual aesthetic, the world she inhabits or wants to, but whether hers or Mr. Archer's, it's not compelling.","Sep 20, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/shit-year/details

Red Riding Trilogy,Manohla Dargis,77,50,"The Red Riding trilogy looks fine blown up on the big screen, though it’s easier to watch at home, where the remote offers fast relief from a grim fiction that, with its murky palette and unyielding cruelty, serves up a nihilistic vision that is unyielding, hermetic, unpersuasive and finally self-indulgent.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/red-riding-trilogy/details

"Dance Party, USA",Jeannette Catsoulis,54,50,"Directed with extraordinary empathy by Aaron Katz (who also wrote the story), Dance Party, USA is an admittedly slight movie, but one that is given heft by a yearning tone and a camera fascinated by the emotional shifts and shadows on a young person's face.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dance-party-usa/details

Outrage,A.O.

Cake,Manohla Dargis,49,50,"It’s the sort of well-intentioned independent effort that can make criticism feel like overkill. There’s nothing to hate, nothing to love.

It Happened in L.A.,Andy Webster,58,50,"As a screenwriter, Ms. Morgan is nimble with glib conversation, and she is fearless at playing an often unlikable character.

The Outlaw Josey Wales,,69,50,"The movie tends to muffle and sell short whatever points it may be trying to make. There seems to be a ghost of an attempt to assert the romantic individualism of the South against the cold expansionism of the North. Every Unionist is vicious and incompetent, whereas Wales, despite his spitting, is really a perfect gentleman. There is something cynical about this primitive one-sidedness in what is not only a historical context, but happens also to be our own historical context.

Kill the Poor,Nathan Lee,52,50,"There's potential here for an incendiary riff on gentrification and its discontents, but the result is only lukewarm.

Sólo con tu pareja,A.O.

Defiance,A.O. Scott,58,50,"Defiance presents itself as an explicit correction of the cultural record, a counterpoint to all those lachrymose World War II tales of helplessness and victimhood. 
This is a perfectly honorable intention, but the problem is that, in setting out to overturn historical stereotypes of Jewish passivity, Mr. Zwick (who co-wrote the screenplay with Clayton Frohman) ends up affirming them.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/defiance/details
Silver City,Dana Stevens,47,50,"Nobody in it seems organically connected to anybody else. In a movie devoted to the idea that everything and everyone is connected, this is a serious failing, and it undermines Mr. Sayles's noble intentions.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/silver-city/details
Dior and I,A.O. Scott,70,50,"There are some amusing moments, to be sure, and some touching ones as well, but the film is less interested in ideas or emotions than in illusions.

The Messengers,,34,50,"Like too many horror pictures, The Messengers becomes more boringly prosaic as it goes along, and there's an 11th-hour plot twist so dumb and poorly articulated that it destroys the movie.

Black Snake Moan,A.O.

Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House,A.O. Scott,49,50,"“Mark Felt” is a sharp portrait set against a blurry background, a history lesson that won’t help you on the test.

Diminished Capacity,Manohla Dargis,54,50,"Touches earnestly on heart-heavy issues of loss: loss of memory, of love and, perhaps because of the local angle, of (or rather by) the Chicago Cubs.

The Forgiveness of Blood,Manohla Dargis,73,50,"Frustratingly, though, perhaps because he is an outsider and was concerned about appearing biased about another culture, about all that Mr. Marston does is chew on this clash, as if the repeated images of teenagers talking on cellphones next to a horse-drawn cart were a substitute for a strong filmmaking point of view.","Feb 23, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-forgiveness-of-blood/details

Martha Marcy May Marlene,A.O.

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,Manohla Dargis,50,50,For the most part this is perfectly painless mush.

Videophilia (and Other Viral Syndromes),Ben Kenigsberg,48,50,"While “Videofilia” is tough to absorb in one viewing, it is hard to escape the sense that Mr. Molero has employed his relentless formal invention in service of some fairly banal moralizing about the dangers of strangers and the internet — a warning that seems late for the here and now.","Dec  1, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/videophilia-and-other-viral-syndromes/details

All the Wilderness,Jeannette Catsoulis,54,50,"Mr. Johnson doesn’t give fateful weight to the breadcrumbs that guide James forward.

The Manson Family,Dana Stevens,56,50,"Finally, though, Mr. Van Bebber seems more interested in recreating the grainy look of scratched 1970's film stock than in reflecting on the horrors he depicts, making this a difficult sell for all but the strongest stomachs among connoisseurs of vintage gore.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-manson-family/details
A Common Thread,Manohla Dargis,63,50,"Unfortunately, Ms. Faucher's screenplay, written with Gaëlle Macé, never finds its focus or reason for being, and Ms. Naymark just doesn't have enough screen presence to make up for the lack of a story or to justify all those tenderly attentive close-ups.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-common-thread/details
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,A.O.

Firehouse Dog,Jeannette Catsoulis,43,50,"Working with four interchangeable Deweys, the filmmakers create a sufficient number of lively stunts to keep the kiddies amused, though the film's wittiest moment -- a canine parody of Dudley Moore's first glimpse of Bo Derek in ""10"" -- will be appreciated only by their parents.

A Bag of Hammers,Andy Webster,50,50,Any film tossing comic interludes among its closing credits has to be convinced of their hilarity and of the good will the movie has earned with viewers by then.

Sleepless Night,Jeannette Catsoulis,75,50,"Hectic and harebrained, this galloping French thriller tosses a potpourri of plot points - crooked cops, sleazy gangsters, stolen drugs and an underage hostage - into a packed-to-the-gills nightclub, and stirs.

Bridget Jones's Baby,Stephen Holden,59,50,"Despite an abundance of mostly tepid jokes that keeps the comedic tone at a quiet simmer, Bridget Jones’s Baby doesn’t jell.

London to Brighton,Manohla Dargis,55,50,"A slice of social realism, a wedge of naturalism, a symbolically freighted fairy tale -- at times, London to Brighton feels like all of these combined, which, before it all turns to mush, gives the film the aspect of a fascinating and ambitious pastiche.

5x2,Dana Stevens,62,50,"Told in the usual sequence, the story of Gilles and Marion would be a banal bell curve of infatuation, bliss, boredom, regret and recrimination. As it is, 5x2 does not quite make the case that Gilles and Marion are entirely worth our interest, let alone our sympathy, but the reversal of narrative order gives their ordinary moments together a faint aura of mystery, as Mr. Ozon teases us with the conceit that it will all make sense in the end - or rather, the beginning.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/5x2/details

Looking for Kitty,Laura Kern,43,50,"This is a modest film on various levels, in terms of budget, length, cast size and technical craft.

Jeff Who Lives at Home,A.O. Scott,60,50,"The ending is also a test of the audience's openness to the kind of fantasy mocked, at the outset, by everyone in Jeff's life, including the filmmakers.

Arbitrage,Manohla Dargis,73,50,"Instead of digging into the psychology and morality of greed, Mr. Jarecki only glances and lectures in that direction before piling on a lot of melodramatic complications, including a death, an investigation and a cynical detective (Tim Roth).

Legally Blonde,Dana Stevens,59,50,"The character as written is incoherent, but Ms. Witherspoon has the reflexes to make Elle both appealing and ridiculous. It's funny -- in that slightly queasy, un-P.C. Doris Day kind of way.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/legally-blonde/details
King Corn,,70,50,"Mr. Cheney and Mr. Ellis are so pleasantly nondescript that they make no particular impression. As a result, all the time spent on autobiographical detail and personal banter hampers the film’s urgency, and plays like an awkward attempt to justify a format that the filmmakers are too self-effacing to exploit.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/king-corn/details
City of Ember,Stephen Holden,58,50,"At only 95 minutes, the movie feels as though it had been shredded in the editing room. In Hollywood-speak, it has a weak second act.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/city-of-ember/details

Mr. & Mrs. Smith,Manohla Dargis,55,40,"What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing and occasionally incoherent action.

Mr. Mom,Janet Maslin,50,40,"Mr. Mom would be funny if it had jokes. That's not so self-evident as it sounds, because it's not a claim that every failed comedy can make.

Force 10 from Navarone,,42,40,"The plot of Force 10 is banally improbable.

Our Kind of Traitor,Manohla Dargis,57,40,"The director Susanna White makes a lot of strange choices, including the dark, fussy visuals best described as stained-glass noir.

Jean Gentil,Rachel Saltz,64,40,"The filmmakers have no patience for details, either basic or telling.

Earthwork,Jeannette Catsoulis,53,40,"Imagine spending an afternoon watching a bunch of vagrants putter around on an abandoned city lot, and you've pretty much nailed the viewing experience of Earthwork, a painfully dull account of a year in the life of the Kansas crop artist Stan Herd.","Apr 28, 2011",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/earthwork/details
The Dictator,A.O. Scott,58,40,"That potential is mostly squandered in The Dictator, which gestures halfheartedly toward topicality and, with equal lack of conviction, toward pure, anarchic silliness.","May 15, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-dictator/details

Finding Fanny,Rachel Saltz,tbd,40,"Ms. Kapadia, now 57 and a Bollywood star since she made a splash in “Bobby,” at 16, inhabits and enhances her role.

Why Stop Now,Stephen Holden,36,40,"Once Why Stop Now? has exhausted its bag of tricks, there is a screeching of brakes as it approaches the edge of the cliff.

Red Tails,Stephen Holden,46,40,To say that this live-action comic book lives up to Mr. Lucas's description is not a wholehearted endorsement.

Kickboxer: Vengeance,Andy Webster,37,40,"Sure, the new action workout Kickboxer: Vengeance — a reboot of a foot-fighting franchise from the 1980s and ’90s — follows a tiresome martial-arts movie formula.

The Royal Road,Glenn Kenny,65,40,"Ms. Olson’s images are often captivating, but too often undercut by the aforementioned aspiring-to-the-dialectical voice-over, which is awkwardly written, and delivered with a lack of affect that grows tedious over the course of an hour.","Oct 29, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-royal-road/details

Losing Control,Nicolas Rapold,33,40,"There are rare flashes of successful humor, as when the film deals with the behavior of jerks and a flustered cabby, but these are not likely to be replicated in the lab.

Confidence,Dana Stevens,59,40,"If Confidence was made by people who have seen too many movies, it seems to be aimed at people who have seen too few.

Bad Fever,Jeannette Catsoulis,43,40,"Mr. Defa and his cinematographer, Mike Gioulakis, are united in their disdain for information over mood: as the camera skitters spastically around its troubled schlub, the film becomes a muddy, minimalist moan of desperation.","Feb  2, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bad-fever/details

Frankenstein's Bloody Nightmare,Laura Kern,38,40,"Purely for curiosity’s sake this unusual, intermittently hypnotic quasi monster flick is worth checking out, at least until the initial ""what is this?"" effect wears off and it becomes as tiresome as listening to someone relate long-winded tales about nightmares or drug-induced exploits.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/frankensteins-bloody-nightmare/details
Danny Collins,Stephen Holden,58,40,What authenticity Mr. Cannavale and Ms. Bening bring to their roles is the sense of groundedness and integrity for one-note characters in a movie whose screenplay is little more than an efficiently executed outline.,"Mar 19, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/danny-collins/details

Primeval,A.O.

Xanadu,,35,40,"Like ""The Wiz,"" though, Xanadu is desperately stylish without having any real style.

The English Teacher,Stephen Holden,42,40,"The acting, especially Ms. Moore’s, is solid.

Marauders,Glenn Kenny,42,40,"Marauders lays out a scenario in the first 40 minutes or so that, oddly enough, makes you think “this is not an entirely uninteresting premise for a thriller.” But after that, things devolve into “this is extremely far-fetched” and, finally, “this is goofy.”","Jun 30, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/marauders/details

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Glenn Kenny,40,40,"This movie is, it happens, easier to sit through than the 2014 film. The 3-D action, overseen by the director Dave Green, is not wholly incoherent.

About Cherry,Stephen Holden,33,40,"The fatal flaw of this well-acted movie, whose creators are sex industry veterans, is its refusal to examine Angelina's occupation from outside the bubble.

Jack Reacher,A.O. Scott,50,40,"Apart from the car chase, the only real fun in Jack Reacher comes from Mr. Herzog and Robert Duvall, called in near the end for some marvelously gratuitous scenery chewing as a gruff former Marine.

The Oranges,Stephen Holden,46,40,"How could a movie starring Hugh Laurie, Oliver Platt, Allison Janney and Catherine Keener go so wrong?

The Double Steps,Manohla Dargis,tbd,40,"It's never clear how Mr. Lacuesta, whose use of other art-cinema conventions (like nonprofessional performers) risks cliché, sees these parts working together or what he wants you to take from them.

Reuniting the Rubins,Neil Genzlinger,31,40,"It's the kind of stuff an amateur screenwriter reaches for when he has nothing original to say, because he's seen it work in other movies. It sure doesn't work here.","Mar 16, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/reuniting-the-rubins/details

Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,A.O. Scott,51,40,"To say that “Valerian” is a science-fiction epic doesn’t quite do it justice.

Assault on Precinct 13,Dana Stevens,54,40,"The main thing this ""Assault"" lacks is a point. Mr. Carpenter's film still resonates with the political paranoia and social unease of the era.

Kingsman: The Secret Service,Manohla Dargis,60,40,"The problem is that Mr. Vaughn has no interest in, or perhaps understanding of, violence as a cinematic tool. He doesn’t use violence; he squanders it.","Feb 12, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kingsman-the-secret-service/details

Life in a Day,Mike Hale,58,40,"It's a hard movie to engage with or even sit through, despite the fact that much of the material is interesting in its own right.

Doomsday,,51,40,"In terms of story, “The Descent” and Doomsday are as different as two genre films can be, but the falloff in artistic quality is still quantifiable. Where “The Descent” was a slow, quiet, exquisitely modulated, startlingly original film, Doomsday is frenetic, loud, wildly imprecise and so derivative that it doesn’t so much seem to reference its antecedents as try on their famous images like a child playing dress-up.

A Dirty Shame,Dana Stevens,56,40,"I object to A Dirty Shame not because it is offensive - to do so would be another way of congratulating Mr. Waters for his bogus daring - but because it is boring.

Wasabi,A.O.

Womb,Jeannette Catsoulis,48,40,"If the 20-odd seconds of blank screen squatting pointlessly amid the opening credits aren't enough warning that you're in for some seriously sluggish storytelling, then the adoption of a snail as one of the central motifs should drive the point home.","Mar 29, 2012",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/womb/details
Doing Time for Patsy Cline,Stephen Holden,51,40,"The saving graces of the film, written and directed by Chris Kennedy, are its performances, especially Mr. Roxburgh's portrayal of a floundering lost soul with little to show for an itinerant life, and Ms. Otto's ditsy, mercurial and ultimately touching country singer.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/doing-time-for-patsy-cline/details

Stay,Manohla Dargis,41,30,"Marc Forster takes a maximalist approach to this mumbo jumbo, which means that in addition to lots of wacky angles, shiny surfaces, seemingly endless stairs, and sets of twins, triplets and quadruplets, he deploys the unsettling vision of three talented actors - Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling - straining credulity and neck tendons in the service of serious claptrap.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/stay/details

The Babysitters,Stephen Holden,35,30,"Shirley’s instant metamorphosis from insecure high school student to ruthless madam is ludicrous in spite of the best efforts of the talented Ms. Waterston to convince you otherwise.

Down Periscope,Stephen Holden,39,30,"If Down Periscope, directed by David S.

Jokes misfire. Gags that are visible from a mile away fail to deliver.,"May 22, 2014",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blended/details
How to Lose Friends & Alienate People,Manohla Dargis,35,0,The crushingly unfunny and slopped-together How to Lose Friends & Alienate People has neither the ambition nor the intelligence to do justice to its source material.,,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/how-to-lose-friends-alienate-people/details

Vice,Jeannette Catsoulis,17,0,"Evidencing more bullets than brains, Vice — a bit of ephemeral science-fiction twaddle directed by Brian A. Miller — has absolutely nothing to recommend it.","Jan 15, 2015",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/vice-2015/details
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,Manohla Dargis,55,0,"See the Holocaust trivialized, glossed over, kitsched up, commercially exploited and hijacked for a tragedy about a Nazi family. Better yet and in all sincerity: don't.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-boy-in-the-striped-pajamas/details

Neander-Jin: The Return of the Neanderthal Man,Nicolas Rapold,tbd,0,"Routinely botching the basics of setting up characters and scenarios, the film lets punch lines die like dogs and at times resembles a pornographic film without the sex.","Jul 25, 2013",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/neander-jin-the-return-of-the-neanderthal-man/details

Baby Geniuses,Elvis Mitchell,6,0,"One way to get through Baby Geniuses is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you've ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/baby-geniuses/details

Air America,Caryn James,33,0,"This muddled film about a secret C.I.A. project in Laos in 1969 fails on every possible level: as action film, as buddy film, as scenic travelogue and even, sad to say, as a way to flaunt Mel Gibson's appeal.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/air-america/details
Hemingway's Garden of Eden,Stephen Holden,28,0,"For all the cinematic crimes against him, there has been no book-to-screen translation of his work quite as atrocious as Hemingway's Garden of Eden.","Dec  9, 2010",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hemingways-garden-of-eden/details

Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party,Glenn Kenny,2,0,"According to a certain interpretation of the auteur theory, a film’s value derives from the extent to which it communicates the personality and character of its director. Judged by that standard alone, I suppose “Hillary’s America” is some kind of masterpiece.","Jul 21, 2016",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party/details

Showgirls,Elvis Mitchell,16,0,"The film makers had declared they were bravely exploring new levels of licentiousness, but the biggest risk they've taken here is making a nearly $40 million movie without anyone who can act.

The Emoji Movie,Glenn Kenny,12,0,"To add to the pain and despair of the experience, The Emoji Movie is preceded by a short, “Puppy,” featuring the characters from the “Hotel Transylvania” animated movies. It is also idiotic.","Jul 27, 2017",http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-emoji-movie/details

Hearts in Atlantis,Stephen Holden,55,0,"Mush, delivered with a trembling, quasi-biblical solemnity, is what emanates from Anthony Hopkins most of the time in Hearts in Atlantis, a nostalgic fiasco so shameless it makes movies like ""Simon Birch"" and ""Frequency"" seem as austere as the work of Robert Bresson.",,http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hearts-in-atlantis/details
